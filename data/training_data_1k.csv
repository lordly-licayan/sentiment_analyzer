sir jovert the energetic kind and considerate teacher which is why the class is also interactive he always show his genuine care to the students and he is the teacher that i prayed in this new mode of learning online classes big respect to sir,1
okay ra nga magkamaestro,1

okay raman siya but he sometimes reason out sa amoa nga busy sya maong dli makasulod usahay,-1
she handled the class very well and i learned a lot about the topics she discusses with us,1
she is very precise with the topic and very resourceful with regards to presentation,1
she presents discussion so well so that we students can easily follow also she initiates open discussion which i enjoy much during our synchronous schedule,1
we may seldomly meet with this subject but the resources that he provides are very important i even wanted to buy a copy of the book but it is always not available he provides reading modules as well as video discussion on the topic for our activity,-1
the materials he uses like video compilations during our meetings shows reality in present society we uses classin platform which is very interactive and so far he is the only instructor i have that created a gc in the lms,1
subject is very challenging specially all our exams and quizzes are oral based but above all the subject is very interesting maybe because he really specify that we must follow what is stated in the law and not on the actual practice,1
what i really level up my interest in this subject is that thou we have a textbook he insures that we also learn what is in the present situation of our country and this subject also pushes as to our usual study habit for all exams are oral recitation,1
good teacher usahay muana siya kabaw ko nakaagi namo ani nga lesson iya expectation tananon nya nga nakabalo pero wa sya kabalo nga dili tanan nakaagi atu na lesson,-1
sometimes good,0

during one of the meetings we had on this subject most of our classmates were unable to access classin because they did not have proper gadgets to support the app she got mad and she accused my classmates of being abusive and di maningkamot,-1

technicalities are not accepted in his class we cant avoid technicalities especially for those who are data users,-1
good instructor,1
i really like how he handles the class it gives us reason to not give up despite of this challenging type of learning style,1
i really wanted to be part of his class again,1
i wanted to be part of his class again for he shows positive vibes and he is always open for all of our concerns,1
i really love to be part of his class again for he shows positive vibes that we students need during this though times,1
aside from she teaches us lessons about phonology she even assess us to be ready for our future i really love how see accepted our mistakes and how she corrected it in a way where we could express ourselves without being judged or discrimination,1
aside from lessons she teaches us on phonology she also teaches how be confident to face our mistakes she never treated us as someone who can never reach her level but see sees us on how she sees herself she prepared us to be like her and to be real,1
a good and moral instructor,1
mangasaba siya if masayup or naa mi hangyo wala mi freedom nga ma express amo selfimbes nga makaton miang amo ma feel kay kahadlok permikuyaw kaayo sa mental healthspecialiy sa mga freshmennaa ko klasmet niingon nga na depress siya ani nga teacher,-1
an ideal math instructor the best siya mo teach sa math,1
concerned siya sa welfare sa mga studyantevery good,1
technicalities are not accepted in his class we cant avoid technicalities especially for those who are data users,-1
she gives a lot of activities even though it is not her time when we ask consideration for time extension of our activities because we have exams or we have a class for the other subjects she said that we should do it and kami na bahala,-1
sigeg hatag ug daghang activites and sometimes mo hatag ug activities nga dili iyahang time or rest day namo sometimes ma attitude kaayo and dili kaayo confident sa iyang discussion,-1
she gives a lot of activities during midterm we only saw her once because its always asynchronous with lots of activities she wants to change our sched time bcos shes not a morning person she wants to change it at night but we didnt agree,-1
since nag change mig teacher pagsugod sa midterm which is sya ang gi ilis wala pa syay meet2 namo then ga sgeg hatag ug buhatonon then not a morning person she even asked a favor from us nga change ug sched or i move,-1
sometimes mag libog mi sa iyang discussion and paspas ra kaayo ang dicussion sometimes kay mag libog pud syas iyang discussion permi mag klase doesnt provides a combination of synchronous and asynchronous mode of teaching,-1
shes a good teacher well managed about the sched but not all students can cope up or understand the discussion i can remember when we are solving and then she said kamo na bhala ana class some students understands it but how about the others,-1
nice sya mo discuss like naay sense but less lang jud ang interaction between niya and students nice jd sya sa teaching and didnt provides a combination of synchronous and asynchronous mode of teaching always sya meet namo,1
hes a great teacher but what we can say is that its exhausting sometimes because he gives a quiz every after the discussion so it means twice a week we have quizzes and its 50 items,0
i have no concerns at all with sir romagos in fact hes a great teacher,1
nice and good teacher,1
shes a good teacher,1
sometimes shes an attitude but so far shes a good teacher,0
sometimes di kaayo mo consider sa mga problems sa students,-1
sometimes she doesnt give considerations but maam suello is really a great teacher she explains well the topic that students can really understand if we dont understand the topic she always gives us motivation or ideas to practice and practice,1
she is a good and approachable instructor that could not make you hesitate to ask,1
saputon kaayo kusog mangyawyaw ug students usahay mamalikas and di mudawat ug consideration sa students sometimes kay dugay musud sa klase and paspas kaayo mo discuss and mayntag i indicate nya ang page sa book kung asa sya ga discuss,-1
im afraid of sir bragat if masuko hes a good teacher but sometimes i dont know what we are discussing bcos we only have books and listen to his voice recording during the google meet i hope that he also indicates that what page of the book or title,-1
doesnt trust students when they are having an internet issue while taking an exam doesnt give second chance uses vulgar words sometimes,-1
the best math teacher,1
she teach math so fast i cant comprehend it well but she is a good teacher,-1
teacher eve is very inconsiderate internet connection is something that is out of our control yet she blames us if we have a slow connection she sets her standards high but fails to provide clear instructions and supervision,-1
her instructions are not clear usually after discussion she will just leave the meeting without asking the students if they have questions or some clarifications also her presentation like the powerpoint is not organized and not comprehensive,-1
she is very nice,1
thankyou,0
miss bitoon always excites me with her warm welcome before we starts our classes she always shares her stories with her family and experiences she is very smiling person and she is very carrying and kind,1
mr pacaldo is the type of teacher that wants you to pay attention to everything he says he is a very calm teacher and friendly he is very understandable but when its urgent everyone should do its part,1
mr apa is very simple yet the smartest when he is teaching he teach smoothly and you can tell that he is well prepared when he enters the meeting he is friendly and calm,1
miss maedyn is the teacher we all wants she makes every topic as simple as abc she is always kind and calm although she is not straighttothetopic type of speaker but atleast we understand her quickly,1
mr physics guy i call him that name because he is the best physics teacher i ever have he is always chill when teaching and you can understand him quickly he doesnt talk much about the things that isnt important thats why you can focus,1
mr alquilita is the type of teacher that keeps the environment chill and fun at the same time because he provides information na mapapa oo ka nalang kasi nga oo nga naman,1
mr dapal is the type of teacher that is allknowing when it comes to history i remembered one of my classmate asked him with a very critical question that i thought he cannot answer but surprisingly i was surprised,1
in your teaching styles and techniques miss maayos naman pagka deliver but in giving activities sana namn maawa ka sa amin because sometimes you give an activities hindi mo schedule i hope you will avoid that thing miss,-1
i really love the way na mo teach ka sa amoa miss i hope miss i will master this subject and be the same as you miss thank you miss,1
sometimes jud miss d jud ko kasabot sa subject but i know miss na imo gi try para makasabot and thank u kaayo miss thank u mga gihatag na rest day nimo miss kay ikaw ra jud mo hatag namo ana ay huhuh i really like your smile miss ay keep ur smile miss,1
i cant understand well the discussions,-1
doesnt respect our personal time gave activities at 9 pm in the evening which is supposedly our time for ourselves gave a lot of assignments to us and provide short time in answering the exams she doesnt follow the asynchronous and synchronous rule,-1
she is a very good teacher i really love how she handle her students,1
she gave a lot of activities that students would go rattled off especially synchronous activity that would complicate like do reporting and would give a time allotted activity which makes most students cant concentrate to the discussion on that day,-1
just with the activities given and not much time given for submission which to think not only with her subject we have activities to do,-1
tons of activity but not much time for submission to think we have a lot of subject as well have activities to be submitted on time,-1
most of her lesson are math which is her major subject she teaches that most of the time does not inline with the said subject we have and it makes students so confuse on the specific subject that has been taken up,-1
sir is very intelligent every topic is well discuss and understandable to us students,1
miss discusses in class about the grades which should be done privately,-1
she has this great teaching skills that makes every students engage in her class always,1
in this subject i dont know she is different but still with the activities given and not much allotted time to do,-1
keep up the good work,1
keep the good work,1
he always having considering students espcially those whos net were not stable and he gave exams or quizzes with extra days so that students can answer well,1
i like the way how she give quizzes or exams because it looks like easy but difficult to understand where it measured the understandings of students,1
i am displeased with this instructor for she doesnt accept suggestions or concerns and when we will have an exam the time limit is so small that we cant answer our exams and it is unreasonable for us i want to pass in sts but it isnt reachable,-1
he is undeniably an amazing professor he is the best that been strict a bit but in a good and right way i like his sense of humor and the way he interact with us i have learned a lot from him,1
i commend sir for always showing up prepared during classes as well as being so organized he gives us enough notes on our discussions gives us enough time for our activity this class has been so much interactive i can really say sir loves his work,1
during our prelim the connection that time was slow it takes time to submit our work since she gave us brief period of time to answer we convince her she gave us 10mins extension but when we checked our score it was deducted inconsiderate ect,-1
we students get confused on what we act during his class for example when we participate or speak up he disregard our opinions and tell to better stay silent and when we dont speak up he will say we are not participative,-1
thankyouu for your kindness godbless,1
sorry miss god bless,0
i hope ms suello respond on our email whenever we have concern so that we will know if our concern is considered or not,-1
she doesnt show to us the result scores of our quizzes and dili namo makita if asa mi dapit nasayop or unsa among dapat sudyhan more because wa man mi basis mag sige ramig take ug quiz nya no scores jud tanan,-1
i hope ms cuevas will be considerate to us,-1

sir nikki is a good teacher,1
in my opinion if hes angry or mad with other class he will include us but i do like sir when he teaches,-1
ms ems is the best and teacher,1
ms generale is good in teaching because you can learn a lot but even in asynchronous time ms generale would meet us and when the students cant answer the oral she will get mad easily,-1
ms faith is also a good teacher but sometimes she forgot the time and leads to overtime then we her students starve also her she gives us lots of tasks to do even though we have lots of tasks to do in other subjects,-1
great teacher even though ms gobs laptop is lagging she can manage to teach us,1
ms eve always mad at us and we dont know why shes not attending the class and when she give us quiz the time limit is too fast and we cant barely finish it she also told us to make the business plan but my other classmates dont know how to make it,-1
thank you for being a good teacher maam,1
nindot unta siya mo tudlo kaso grabe makahatag buhatonon way uso hatag pahuway sa student niya di ra baya siya amo teacher nga ga hatag activity di pud lalim niya lisod2 pud siyag ipabuhat,-1
with regards to giving activities pls do follow the time and date of the subject schedule for us to adjust our time because we also have other activities to do,-1

one of the most understandable and kind professor,1
the best teacher i know very considerate and jolly the class never gets boring,1
very openminded and understanding professor,1
we cannot reach her sometimes because she will just ignore our concerns but we understand her because she is also busy student,-1
good teacher in history,1
he stands both as a teacher and a parent he was able to give us advice in coping up the struggles during the online class as we are freshmen,1
take care and godbless u,1
thank you so much sir because youre not pressuring us keep it up,1
overall he is a good instructor who helps students to learn a lot and examine their potential for accounting he gives understanding to those students who have an unstable connection,1

ganahan kyko the way ka mo teach miss kay makasabot jd mi tanan amping permi,1
amping permi sir,1
i really love how ms eds elaborates her discussions along the way,1
maam ygonia did a pretty good job specially during the discussion she would always correct our mistakes and helps us out along the discussion but is sometimes strict in terms of our classmates being late without hearing their reasons but only sometimes,1
i really admire sir mel because he is very open to each and everyone of us and also considers our own opinions and will help us understand the discussions further he also interacts with us and made the discussion more entertaining,1
maam amadora did great in elaborating her discussion i am just concern for those student including myself who is more comfortable with some presentation presented if only maam amadora had some ppt it would have been great but over all maam is good,1
for me i hope the prof will consider about our connection problem because we are not the same situation that having a stable network and please be professional about your words,-1
continue of being a good instuctor,1
i hope that you have the consideration with your students and please lower your expectations to us because we are not einstein i hope that you should make discussions because not all students are good as you especially because youre our major subject,-1
sir have a very close mind and di maminaw sa amoang concerns always nalang iyaha matuman galisod pud mis klase kay maybe wala lang ko naanad the way siya mo tudlo sa amoa i am pressured tungod atung niana siya na mga brayt ming tanan tungod kani amoa,-1
nice teacher and he understand what the students feels,1
sir kaloy somehow helps me in lifting up myself sa time that i was down because of tons of school works,1
mr danilo is a great teacher however i could not understand him sometimes he discusses a certain topic yet the exams are a bit unrelated too medicalrelated to the discussed topics he also doesnt give immediate feedback for us to review our exams,-1
she handles our class and the students very well she is the most understanding teacher for me and although i sometimes get late because of my work i can still understand the topics very well as her ppts are ver wellorganized,1
wla ko ka uyon sa iyang pag tudlo mag basa ra siya sa iyang ppt unsaon pag concentrate kung ang iyang g tudlo basahon rpd namo sa screen then gamay kaayu mo hatag og grado taas kaayug standards tas iyang pag tudlo wla ka abot sa standard,-1
this teacher is really considerate and very downtoearth he delivers and handles the class very well,1
she rarely attends her classes and she doesnt give clear instructions when giving activities,-1
thank you sir for always making us happy and motivated,1
hes good at teaching most of us his students can always understand the lesson but sometimes he cant refrain from saying curse or vulgar words during our class,-1
she is not using her synchronous time to virtually meet us she just sends us a recorded video clip of her lesson and i cant ask her personally if ever i have questions regarding the topic that she sends,-1
great teacher but the given time for the quiz is not enough especially for the students that are not good at math while sa solutionsit has to be neat and tungod sa gidali medyo hugaw nya theres no time to rewrite na then naa raba score sayang pud,-1
very energetic and motivating si sir,1
approachable and patient ,1
understanding and considerate ,1
thank you for inspiring caring listening guiding and shaping our future i would want you to know that you are without a doubt pretty much the best teacher of all time in the history of ever,1
this professor was very rude to us on our 2nd day of class meeting this professor was saying profanity in front of us she was saying bullshit that time and other rude or hurtful words she also kick lots of my classmates during her time,-1
i like her as our teacher but sometimes she keeps on sending video that we need to udnerstand without duscussing about the vid,-1
he didnt even accepts or consider any situation that happens to me and my classmates we all know that wifi connection is not that always active so its not our fault to out from the gmeet but she cant even understand it im really disappointed,-1
very unprofessional and does not handle the class well and also treats us like mindless robots on quiz that have so short time he does not lessen,-1
maam olga cant even consider about the situation she doesnt want to give any chances to all the students like me im really sad because all of the students has a different situation i cried for quiz that i cant finish because of the poor connection,-1
waste of money didnt learn anything from him he is very unprofessional and very conceited he rarely discusses and gives us a quiz with very little to no time to answer he also discourages other students that answer his questions wrong,-1
so far she is quite good instructor,1
i learned a lot from him and he is a very considerate teacher ,1
a good teacher,1
so far he is quite good instructor,1
sometimes sends activities late we have little time to make them,-1
so far she is quite good instructor,1
i learned a lot from him he is a very good teacher,1
the above result shows how ineffective of a teacher he ishe often concerns himself with students cheating but he is already affecting the students who are working hard to pass he gives out exams that are impossible to pass due to lack of time,-1
i learned a lot from him his discussion is very clear and very easy to understand he is very considerate to the students 1010,1
using foul word one time during our discussion didnt provide proper instructions and wont reply to our concerns,-1
a very good teacher,1
so far he is quite good instructor,1
a good teacher,1
the way miss discussed is very efficient but when miss gave 2 activities in her time i always felt nervous as time was running and what if i cant pass before the due timefor me this is really a disadvantage of miss having 2 activities in a time,0
every time we had a discussions she really elaborate the topics very well and i like it,1
very nice teacher,1
maam jennifer amores is one of the best computer instructor that ive known in my schooling journey,1

shes so good at teaching,1
shes the best of all instructors ive known the way she handle the class i really love listening to her every time she discusses about her lesson she will connect it in real life situations so that we can relate to her discussions all in all shes good,1
so good at influencing the students to be resourceful,1
sir gaps is also a great instructor he never failed us to laugh because of his funny ambiance and personality i can conclude that he really handle the whole class without any hassles,1
sir damuag is one of my favorite instructor because the way he handle the class he is really good and doing his duties with all his heart also the way he discuss his lessons i really love listening to him i dont feel any sleepy thought or what,1

hes a great mathematics instructor,1
the best rotc instructor ive known he didnt disappointed us the way he handle us un classes and if ever the face to face classes is being approved by the dean i would really love to learn more with sir viodor,1
sir angelo is also one of my favorite instructor in uc because of his funny personality and also his way of handling us he always motivates us and never disappoint us,1
thank you for teaching us lezzzgoooo,1
you can surely learn from him not only thus he makes the discussion seem easy or like very understandable even if it is a bit complicated but he can give out good examples that is an extra help for our learning,1
hes good but sometimes i think that he is like not ready whenever he has discussions i cant also explain why but pretty understandable,-1
probably of my favorite teacher youo can really get a lot to her but sometimes the activities are little bit too much within the time limit but its good way to train us my fellow students,0
also a good teacher but sometimes the activities and assignment is way too much,-1
he rarely attends his classes but often he is very aggressive in a way that he sometimes threatens us to give us low marks even if he didnt discuss something well his teaching skills is good,-1
he does not accept opinions or students excuses and disregards them in an offensive way also he marks students absent even if we were in his class,-1
i think he went too over in relating real life situation and instead he his telling his life stories and not discussion we acknowledge that he has achievement but i think there should be a time that we should focus on topics about the subject,-1
very nice and understanding teacher i really love how he handles his students and the vibe he give makes us less stress but also learning a lot,1
a very effective teacher you could really understand everything like even the tiny bits of a lesson she is indeed a teacher,1
shes good but sometimes she doesnt attend classes,-1
he does not accept students idea and wants his idea to be followed he is sometimes very unreasonable when it comes too score of assignments also the recorded discussions isnt that engaging for me,-1
keep up the good work,1
di mohatag og oras para maminaw sa concern mga students unresponsive,-1
goods no problem,1
a well done instructor thank you ms abby,1
he is a very reliable teacher thank you so much for teaching us,1
sometimes sir jorge answer the students concern but sometimes not i know that he is always busy because he handles many students and also handle other subject so it will be okay for me since there is an accurate reason,0
he is a good and understanding teacher,1
maam is very good at delivering the topic to the class but she is too strict that mostly students is afraid to talk with her or answer her questions but i know this will do good for us to enhance our capability in speaking english accurately,1
sir abella rarely discuss to us he will just assign all of us to do the reporting video discussion one by one and we are having a hard time because we rarely had no idea with the topic cause we just search for answer online mostly students had no book,-1
sir joey is really a jolly teacher and so kind because he give chance for those students who are lacking and the way sir discuss he made it clear and easier for us to understand the topic very well the reason why we are satisfied for his teaching types,1
pwde hinay2 lng ta ig discuss miss hehe,-1
sir ababon is really a good teacher because he give a chance for those students who are lacking thus understand the students reasons gracefully moreover sir gives us a long deadline for our tasks that makes us relieved,1
bilib ko nga pagka maestro strikto pero naas lugar ug maayo mo hatag ug grado,1
hes very inconsiderate to students even though provided with valid evidence and reasons hes very unprofessional when in terms of giving major exams prelim and midterm major exam should be taken seriously not a game that is done through quizizzcom,-1
