sir jovert the energetic kind and considerate teacher which is why the class is also interactive he always show his genuine care to the students and he is the teacher that i prayed in this new mode of learning online classes big respect to sir,1
okay ra nga magkamaestro,1

okay raman siya but he sometimes reason out sa amoa nga busy sya maong dli makasulod usahay,-1
she handled the class very well and i learned a lot about the topics she discusses with us,1
she is very precise with the topic and very resourceful with regards to presentation,1
she presents discussion so well so that we students can easily follow also she initiates open discussion which i enjoy much during our synchronous schedule,1
we may seldomly meet with this subject but the resources that he provides are very important i even wanted to buy a copy of the book but it is always not available he provides reading modules as well as video discussion on the topic for our activity,-1
the materials he uses like video compilations during our meetings shows reality in present society we uses classin platform which is very interactive and so far he is the only instructor i have that created a gc in the lms,1
subject is very challenging specially all our exams and quizzes are oral based but above all the subject is very interesting maybe because he really specify that we must follow what is stated in the law and not on the actual practice,1
what i really level up my interest in this subject is that thou we have a textbook he insures that we also learn what is in the present situation of our country and this subject also pushes as to our usual study habit for all exams are oral recitation,1
good teacher usahay muana siya kabaw ko nakaagi namo ani nga lesson iya expectation tananon nya nga nakabalo pero wa sya kabalo nga dili tanan nakaagi atu na lesson,-1
sometimes good,0

during one of the meetings we had on this subject most of our classmates were unable to access classin because they did not have proper gadgets to support the app she got mad and she accused my classmates of being abusive and di maningkamot,-1

technicalities are not accepted in his class we cant avoid technicalities especially for those who are data users,-1
good instructor,1
i really like how he handles the class it gives us reason to not give up despite of this challenging type of learning style,1
i really wanted to be part of his class again,1
i wanted to be part of his class again for he shows positive vibes and he is always open for all of our concerns,1
i really love to be part of his class again for he shows positive vibes that we students need during this though times,1
aside from she teaches us lessons about phonology she even assess us to be ready for our future i really love how see accepted our mistakes and how she corrected it in a way where we could express ourselves without being judged or discrimination,1
aside from lessons she teaches us on phonology she also teaches how be confident to face our mistakes she never treated us as someone who can never reach her level but see sees us on how she sees herself she prepared us to be like her and to be real,1
a good and moral instructor,1
mangasaba siya if masayup or naa mi hangyo wala mi freedom nga ma express amo selfimbes nga makaton miang amo ma feel kay kahadlok permikuyaw kaayo sa mental healthspecialiy sa mga freshmennaa ko klasmet niingon nga na depress siya ani nga teacher,-1
an ideal math instructor the best siya mo teach sa math,1
concerned siya sa welfare sa mga studyantevery good,1
technicalities are not accepted in his class we cant avoid technicalities especially for those who are data users,-1
she gives a lot of activities even though it is not her time when we ask consideration for time extension of our activities because we have exams or we have a class for the other subjects she said that we should do it and kami na bahala,-1
sigeg hatag ug daghang activites and sometimes mo hatag ug activities nga dili iyahang time or rest day namo sometimes ma attitude kaayo and dili kaayo confident sa iyang discussion,-1
she gives a lot of activities during midterm we only saw her once because its always asynchronous with lots of activities she wants to change our sched time bcos shes not a morning person she wants to change it at night but we didnt agree,-1
since nag change mig teacher pagsugod sa midterm which is sya ang gi ilis wala pa syay meet2 namo then ga sgeg hatag ug buhatonon then not a morning person she even asked a favor from us nga change ug sched or i move,-1
sometimes mag libog mi sa iyang discussion and paspas ra kaayo ang dicussion sometimes kay mag libog pud syas iyang discussion permi mag klase doesnt provides a combination of synchronous and asynchronous mode of teaching,-1
shes a good teacher well managed about the sched but not all students can cope up or understand the discussion i can remember when we are solving and then she said kamo na bhala ana class some students understands it but how about the others,-1
nice sya mo discuss like naay sense but less lang jud ang interaction between niya and students nice jd sya sa teaching and didnt provides a combination of synchronous and asynchronous mode of teaching always sya meet namo,1
hes a great teacher but what we can say is that its exhausting sometimes because he gives a quiz every after the discussion so it means twice a week we have quizzes and its 50 items,0
i have no concerns at all with sir romagos in fact hes a great teacher,1
nice and good teacher,1
shes a good teacher,1
sometimes shes an attitude but so far shes a good teacher,0
sometimes di kaayo mo consider sa mga problems sa students,-1
sometimes she doesnt give considerations but maam suello is really a great teacher she explains well the topic that students can really understand if we dont understand the topic she always gives us motivation or ideas to practice and practice,1
she is a good and approachable instructor that could not make you hesitate to ask,1
saputon kaayo kusog mangyawyaw ug students usahay mamalikas and di mudawat ug consideration sa students sometimes kay dugay musud sa klase and paspas kaayo mo discuss and mayntag i indicate nya ang page sa book kung asa sya ga discuss,-1
im afraid of sir bragat if masuko hes a good teacher but sometimes i dont know what we are discussing bcos we only have books and listen to his voice recording during the google meet i hope that he also indicates that what page of the book or title,-1
doesnt trust students when they are having an internet issue while taking an exam doesnt give second chance uses vulgar words sometimes,-1
the best math teacher,1
she teach math so fast i cant comprehend it well but she is a good teacher,-1
teacher eve is very inconsiderate internet connection is something that is out of our control yet she blames us if we have a slow connection she sets her standards high but fails to provide clear instructions and supervision,-1
her instructions are not clear usually after discussion she will just leave the meeting without asking the students if they have questions or some clarifications also her presentation like the powerpoint is not organized and not comprehensive,-1
she is very nice,1
thankyou,0
miss bitoon always excites me with her warm welcome before we starts our classes she always shares her stories with her family and experiences she is very smiling person and she is very carrying and kind,1
mr pacaldo is the type of teacher that wants you to pay attention to everything he says he is a very calm teacher and friendly he is very understandable but when its urgent everyone should do its part,1
mr apa is very simple yet the smartest when he is teaching he teach smoothly and you can tell that he is well prepared when he enters the meeting he is friendly and calm,1
miss maedyn is the teacher we all wants she makes every topic as simple as abc she is always kind and calm although she is not straighttothetopic type of speaker but atleast we understand her quickly,1
mr physics guy i call him that name because he is the best physics teacher i ever have he is always chill when teaching and you can understand him quickly he doesnt talk much about the things that isnt important thats why you can focus,1
mr alquilita is the type of teacher that keeps the environment chill and fun at the same time because he provides information na mapapa oo ka nalang kasi nga oo nga naman,1
mr dapal is the type of teacher that is allknowing when it comes to history i remembered one of my classmate asked him with a very critical question that i thought he cannot answer but surprisingly i was surprised,1
in your teaching styles and techniques miss maayos naman pagka deliver but in giving activities sana namn maawa ka sa amin because sometimes you give an activities hindi mo schedule i hope you will avoid that thing miss,-1
i really love the way na mo teach ka sa amoa miss i hope miss i will master this subject and be the same as you miss thank you miss,1
sometimes jud miss d jud ko kasabot sa subject but i know miss na imo gi try para makasabot and thank u kaayo miss thank u mga gihatag na rest day nimo miss kay ikaw ra jud mo hatag namo ana ay huhuh i really like your smile miss ay keep ur smile miss,1
i cant understand well the discussions,-1
doesnt respect our personal time gave activities at 9 pm in the evening which is supposedly our time for ourselves gave a lot of assignments to us and provide short time in answering the exams she doesnt follow the asynchronous and synchronous rule,-1
she is a very good teacher i really love how she handle her students,1
she gave a lot of activities that students would go rattled off especially synchronous activity that would complicate like do reporting and would give a time allotted activity which makes most students cant concentrate to the discussion on that day,-1
just with the activities given and not much time given for submission which to think not only with her subject we have activities to do,-1
tons of activity but not much time for submission to think we have a lot of subject as well have activities to be submitted on time,-1
most of her lesson are math which is her major subject she teaches that most of the time does not inline with the said subject we have and it makes students so confuse on the specific subject that has been taken up,-1
sir is very intelligent every topic is well discuss and understandable to us students,1
miss discusses in class about the grades which should be done privately,-1
she has this great teaching skills that makes every students engage in her class always,1
in this subject i dont know she is different but still with the activities given and not much allotted time to do,-1
keep up the good work,1
keep the good work,1
he always having considering students espcially those whos net were not stable and he gave exams or quizzes with extra days so that students can answer well,1
i like the way how she give quizzes or exams because it looks like easy but difficult to understand where it measured the understandings of students,1
i am displeased with this instructor for she doesnt accept suggestions or concerns and when we will have an exam the time limit is so small that we cant answer our exams and it is unreasonable for us i want to pass in sts but it isnt reachable,-1
he is undeniably an amazing professor he is the best that been strict a bit but in a good and right way i like his sense of humor and the way he interact with us i have learned a lot from him,1
i commend sir for always showing up prepared during classes as well as being so organized he gives us enough notes on our discussions gives us enough time for our activity this class has been so much interactive i can really say sir loves his work,1
during our prelim the connection that time was slow it takes time to submit our work since she gave us brief period of time to answer we convince her she gave us 10mins extension but when we checked our score it was deducted inconsiderate ect,-1
we students get confused on what we act during his class for example when we participate or speak up he disregard our opinions and tell to better stay silent and when we dont speak up he will say we are not participative,-1
thankyouu for your kindness godbless,1
sorry miss god bless,0
i hope ms suello respond on our email whenever we have concern so that we will know if our concern is considered or not,-1
she doesnt show to us the result scores of our quizzes and dili namo makita if asa mi dapit nasayop or unsa among dapat sudyhan more because wa man mi basis mag sige ramig take ug quiz nya no scores jud tanan,-1
i hope ms cuevas will be considerate to us,-1

sir nikki is a good teacher,1
in my opinion if hes angry or mad with other class he will include us but i do like sir when he teaches,-1
ms ems is the best and teacher,1
ms generale is good in teaching because you can learn a lot but even in asynchronous time ms generale would meet us and when the students cant answer the oral she will get mad easily,-1
ms faith is also a good teacher but sometimes she forgot the time and leads to overtime then we her students starve also her she gives us lots of tasks to do even though we have lots of tasks to do in other subjects,-1
great teacher even though ms gobs laptop is lagging she can manage to teach us,1
ms eve always mad at us and we dont know why shes not attending the class and when she give us quiz the time limit is too fast and we cant barely finish it she also told us to make the business plan but my other classmates dont know how to make it,-1
thank you for being a good teacher maam,1
nindot unta siya mo tudlo kaso grabe makahatag buhatonon way uso hatag pahuway sa student niya di ra baya siya amo teacher nga ga hatag activity di pud lalim niya lisod2 pud siyag ipabuhat,-1
with regards to giving activities pls do follow the time and date of the subject schedule for us to adjust our time because we also have other activities to do,-1

one of the most understandable and kind professor,1
the best teacher i know very considerate and jolly the class never gets boring,1
very openminded and understanding professor,1
we cannot reach her sometimes because she will just ignore our concerns but we understand her because she is also busy student,-1
good teacher in history,1
he stands both as a teacher and a parent he was able to give us advice in coping up the struggles during the online class as we are freshmen,1
take care and godbless u,1
thank you so much sir because youre not pressuring us keep it up,1
overall he is a good instructor who helps students to learn a lot and examine their potential for accounting he gives understanding to those students who have an unstable connection,1

ganahan kyko the way ka mo teach miss kay makasabot jd mi tanan amping permi,1
amping permi sir,1
i really love how ms eds elaborates her discussions along the way,1
maam ygonia did a pretty good job specially during the discussion she would always correct our mistakes and helps us out along the discussion but is sometimes strict in terms of our classmates being late without hearing their reasons but only sometimes,1
i really admire sir mel because he is very open to each and everyone of us and also considers our own opinions and will help us understand the discussions further he also interacts with us and made the discussion more entertaining,1
maam amadora did great in elaborating her discussion i am just concern for those student including myself who is more comfortable with some presentation presented if only maam amadora had some ppt it would have been great but over all maam is good,1
for me i hope the prof will consider about our connection problem because we are not the same situation that having a stable network and please be professional about your words,-1
continue of being a good instuctor,1
i hope that you have the consideration with your students and please lower your expectations to us because we are not einstein i hope that you should make discussions because not all students are good as you especially because youre our major subject,-1
sir have a very close mind and di maminaw sa amoang concerns always nalang iyaha matuman galisod pud mis klase kay maybe wala lang ko naanad the way siya mo tudlo sa amoa i am pressured tungod atung niana siya na mga brayt ming tanan tungod kani amoa,-1
nice teacher and he understand what the students feels,1
sir kaloy somehow helps me in lifting up myself sa time that i was down because of tons of school works,1
mr danilo is a great teacher however i could not understand him sometimes he discusses a certain topic yet the exams are a bit unrelated too medicalrelated to the discussed topics he also doesnt give immediate feedback for us to review our exams,-1
she handles our class and the students very well she is the most understanding teacher for me and although i sometimes get late because of my work i can still understand the topics very well as her ppts are ver wellorganized,1
wla ko ka uyon sa iyang pag tudlo mag basa ra siya sa iyang ppt unsaon pag concentrate kung ang iyang g tudlo basahon rpd namo sa screen then gamay kaayu mo hatag og grado taas kaayug standards tas iyang pag tudlo wla ka abot sa standard,-1
this teacher is really considerate and very downtoearth he delivers and handles the class very well,1
she rarely attends her classes and she doesnt give clear instructions when giving activities,-1
thank you sir for always making us happy and motivated,1
hes good at teaching most of us his students can always understand the lesson but sometimes he cant refrain from saying curse or vulgar words during our class,-1
she is not using her synchronous time to virtually meet us she just sends us a recorded video clip of her lesson and i cant ask her personally if ever i have questions regarding the topic that she sends,-1
great teacher but the given time for the quiz is not enough especially for the students that are not good at math while sa solutionsit has to be neat and tungod sa gidali medyo hugaw nya theres no time to rewrite na then naa raba score sayang pud,-1
very energetic and motivating si sir,1
approachable and patient ,1
understanding and considerate ,1
thank you for inspiring caring listening guiding and shaping our future i would want you to know that you are without a doubt pretty much the best teacher of all time in the history of ever,1
this professor was very rude to us on our 2nd day of class meeting this professor was saying profanity in front of us she was saying bullshit that time and other rude or hurtful words she also kick lots of my classmates during her time,-1
i like her as our teacher but sometimes she keeps on sending video that we need to udnerstand without duscussing about the vid,-1
he didnt even accepts or consider any situation that happens to me and my classmates we all know that wifi connection is not that always active so its not our fault to out from the gmeet but she cant even understand it im really disappointed,-1
very unprofessional and does not handle the class well and also treats us like mindless robots on quiz that have so short time he does not lessen,-1
maam olga cant even consider about the situation she doesnt want to give any chances to all the students like me im really sad because all of the students has a different situation i cried for quiz that i cant finish because of the poor connection,-1
waste of money didnt learn anything from him he is very unprofessional and very conceited he rarely discusses and gives us a quiz with very little to no time to answer he also discourages other students that answer his questions wrong,-1
so far she is quite good instructor,1
i learned a lot from him and he is a very considerate teacher ,1
a good teacher,1
so far he is quite good instructor,1
sometimes sends activities late we have little time to make them,-1
so far she is quite good instructor,1
i learned a lot from him he is a very good teacher,1
the above result shows how ineffective of a teacher he ishe often concerns himself with students cheating but he is already affecting the students who are working hard to pass he gives out exams that are impossible to pass due to lack of time,-1
i learned a lot from him his discussion is very clear and very easy to understand he is very considerate to the students 1010,1
using foul word one time during our discussion didnt provide proper instructions and wont reply to our concerns,-1
a very good teacher,1
so far he is quite good instructor,1
a good teacher,1
the way miss discussed is very efficient but when miss gave 2 activities in her time i always felt nervous as time was running and what if i cant pass before the due timefor me this is really a disadvantage of miss having 2 activities in a time,0
every time we had a discussions she really elaborate the topics very well and i like it,1
very nice teacher,1
maam jennifer amores is one of the best computer instructor that ive known in my schooling journey,1

shes so good at teaching,1
shes the best of all instructors ive known the way she handle the class i really love listening to her every time she discusses about her lesson she will connect it in real life situations so that we can relate to her discussions all in all shes good,1
so good at influencing the students to be resourceful,1
sir gaps is also a great instructor he never failed us to laugh because of his funny ambiance and personality i can conclude that he really handle the whole class without any hassles,1
sir damuag is one of my favorite instructor because the way he handle the class he is really good and doing his duties with all his heart also the way he discuss his lessons i really love listening to him i dont feel any sleepy thought or what,1

hes a great mathematics instructor,1
the best rotc instructor ive known he didnt disappointed us the way he handle us un classes and if ever the face to face classes is being approved by the dean i would really love to learn more with sir viodor,1
sir angelo is also one of my favorite instructor in uc because of his funny personality and also his way of handling us he always motivates us and never disappoint us,1
thank you for teaching us lezzzgoooo,1
you can surely learn from him not only thus he makes the discussion seem easy or like very understandable even if it is a bit complicated but he can give out good examples that is an extra help for our learning,1
hes good but sometimes i think that he is like not ready whenever he has discussions i cant also explain why but pretty understandable,-1
probably of my favorite teacher youo can really get a lot to her but sometimes the activities are little bit too much within the time limit but its good way to train us my fellow students,0
also a good teacher but sometimes the activities and assignment is way too much,-1
he rarely attends his classes but often he is very aggressive in a way that he sometimes threatens us to give us low marks even if he didnt discuss something well his teaching skills is good,-1
he does not accept opinions or students excuses and disregards them in an offensive way also he marks students absent even if we were in his class,-1
i think he went too over in relating real life situation and instead he his telling his life stories and not discussion we acknowledge that he has achievement but i think there should be a time that we should focus on topics about the subject,-1
very nice and understanding teacher i really love how he handles his students and the vibe he give makes us less stress but also learning a lot,1
a very effective teacher you could really understand everything like even the tiny bits of a lesson she is indeed a teacher,1
shes good but sometimes she doesnt attend classes,-1
he does not accept students idea and wants his idea to be followed he is sometimes very unreasonable when it comes too score of assignments also the recorded discussions isnt that engaging for me,-1
keep up the good work,1
di mohatag og oras para maminaw sa concern mga students unresponsive,-1
goods no problem,1
a well done instructor thank you ms abby,1
he is a very reliable teacher thank you so much for teaching us,1
sometimes sir jorge answer the students concern but sometimes not i know that he is always busy because he handles many students and also handle other subject so it will be okay for me since there is an accurate reason,0
he is a good and understanding teacher,1
maam is very good at delivering the topic to the class but she is too strict that mostly students is afraid to talk with her or answer her questions but i know this will do good for us to enhance our capability in speaking english accurately,1
sir abella rarely discuss to us he will just assign all of us to do the reporting video discussion one by one and we are having a hard time because we rarely had no idea with the topic cause we just search for answer online mostly students had no book,-1
sir joey is really a jolly teacher and so kind because he give chance for those students who are lacking and the way sir discuss he made it clear and easier for us to understand the topic very well the reason why we are satisfied for his teaching types,1
pwde hinay2 lng ta ig discuss miss hehe,-1
sir ababon is really a good teacher because he give a chance for those students who are lacking thus understand the students reasons gracefully moreover sir gives us a long deadline for our tasks that makes us relieved,1
bilib ko nga pagka maestro strikto pero naas lugar ug maayo mo hatag ug grado,1
hes very inconsiderate to students even though provided with valid evidence and reasons hes very unprofessional when in terms of giving major exams prelim and midterm major exam should be taken seriously not a game that is done through quizizzcom,-1

i hope miss lauro will teach us and give us instructions in a not very confusing,-1
his way of teaching inhibits the learning of the student through a very limited time of given time when it comes to quizzes and exams,-1
gives us chances of submitting our activities even though its late,1
inhibits the learning of the student by limiting the time when taking quizzes and exams,-1
a good and nice but strict teacher,1

this prof is so inconsiderate in terms of weekends and in giving of grades i am always present gave my oral recitation during his class i always have a passing grade however he gave me the lowest grade which is very rude hope hell change his attitude,-1
she keeps on sending us a yt video about her lesson and didnt give a time to discuss about it if we will ask her some questions she will just said just look the video and you will understand she supposed to teach us so we could learn the lesson,-1
inconsiderate instructor and terror favorite to inclination and embarrassment of the student,-1

i hope that he will response to our concerns especially in submitting activities i hope that he will just gives us minus points if ever we submit the activities late because we try everything we do just to answer the activity thank you and god bless,-1
a good educator he always finds ways to make his discussions alive,1
she is very kind and punctual,1

nothing to change mr oribe is very good teacher,1
limited discussion the class often do the reporting but it was okay however the scores of our activities are not provided and it somehow frustrates my classmates but thank you i still learned from this subject,-1
miss raiza is very informative in her discussions and allow students to interact she handles the class very well and is also understandable if the students cannot attend the class because of the slow internet and power interruption thank you,1
when we have technical problem he wont consider it and also when we cant pass on time because we cant open our lms or have a low network and we going to ask him a chance he didnt give us a chance,-1
scores of our activities are not provided during the exam the items is higher than the time given which is highly frustrating and we cant even go back to the previous numbers to review our answers i learned from that but i hoped that will change pls,-1
my only concern with our instructor on this subject is he does not give chances to students who miss quizzes or exams especially when the reason is valid it is unfair for us and i hope this will be addressed to him and hopefully he will reconsider,-1
we are so confident during his class we participate ang gaining points we pass the quizes and exam and sometimes we dont pass but why our grades we are so disappointed all of my cm asking why their grades are just like that,-1
very good teacher one of the most outstanding,1
very good at teaching one of the most outstanding teacher i know,1
this teacher is okay what i dont understand is his midterm grade that is given to me because i think he didnt compute well because my scores in quizzes and major exam is good i have good score yet he gave me a very low midterm grade,-1
the teacher is never there at all times we only meet her once and that was it she put down schedule to the lms ahead of time even if we didnt meet and we as her students suffer from lack of learning due to not being interacted by the teacher,-1
very good teacher xiexie sir xin xiong,1
i only met this teacher once during the first day of class and after that she never had any synchronous class during class time she only give quizzes during mondays and activities during tuesdays in her subject she only gave video tutorial in youtube,-1
good,1
not accepting the reason of students especially during quiz we not attend cause of internet connection they not give chance,-1
good teacher,1
as what i have observe during our session and asynchronous time and when she gave her students an activitiy i have observed that she have a high standard of giving grades to us almost all of my classmates are dissapointed when we have saw our grade,0
she is the best instructor that i have,1
was willing to learn but we need proper support,0
sir altubar is a wellcomposed man i wouldnt have a problem with him who manage to use his time and discussions every class with a 7am class he still manages to attend and provide insightful discussion,1
his ppt are from google with 100 or 60 slides and it is too long for us to read the full lessons he shows us a video but we cant understand it during our asynchronous session he will give a test that is not related to the references he shared with us,-1
gives low grades inspite of complying activities and quizzes,-1
her standard is so high she will not let us contact her when we have questions during asynchronous times i think that she didnt consider us students that we have different capacities in learning,-1
miss sembrana is taking her profession seriously and its a great thing because we learned a lot from her,1
she is good,1
he is a great teacher,1
i can say that he is the best teacher in philo i could think of,1
she is good but she can do better,0
sir arsolo is one of the most intelligent teachers i have ever met he is taking his profession seriously,1
i loved the way he discussed most of us are just exploring the lms he also teach us on how to used it,1
in teaching he finds ways to understand the students well but sometimes in some opinions of the students he cannot accept the thoughts of the students sometimes his attitude the way he convey to us are just like normal people,-1
the way she teach she can delivered as well and good teaching but sometimes she forgot to the way she talk to our last session,0
in giving the activity there are times that short period of time,-1
very good at all everything is good i dont have any problem of his doings,1
very good in everything,1
an instructor should be aware that hisher students are having a hard time it is never right to say kamo nay bahala ana class or kamo nalay tiwas when in fact heshe is fully aware of hisher students score and were not ang uban ambot lang,-1
she only gaves us a short time to answer the quizzes even though a lot of items sometimes she respond like a sarcasm for us she dont use her subject time she use her own time even though we have scheduled time,-1
very strict,0
good instructor,1
his a responsible teacher he always attend in our class and follow the synchronous and asynchronous session but this midterm i am so confused why he gave me low grade even if i completed all the task he gave and i have a complete attendance in his class,-1
never,0
he dont discuss much his topics but still we manage to pass and comply the task he given but im so confused in his grading system honestly,-1
no comment miss jasmin is a good teacher for me,0

hes a good teacher for me,1

unproffessional,-1
unprofessional,-1
he is a nice instructor he explains also every topic regarding on the suject matter i gave him highest points,1
i like her she is very kind and gave chance to students who submitted late assignmebts due to some important reasons she gave high scores to her students who submitted learning activities i gave her high scores also in my evaluation,1
mr m i learned on his class regarding on real estate laws legalterms etc he attented students concern and questions although his style of exam is oral and strict but it is good coz it makes the students to learn and take effort on studying,1
the best english teacher so far she always listen to the students,1
i learned a lot of things from sir we really like to attend his class because he explains the topics very clear his teaching style is very efficient he always lets us understand the topic because he is also aware that his subject is a bit difficult,1
tbh i didnt learn anything from sir because he never discuss with us and he always give assignments or quizzes as gifts we got really good grades in his subject but we dont have any learning at all i hope he will not handle any subject next sem,-1
our english this sem is very great miss let us report the topics for this semester but at the same time she always gives us sources and other information about the topics to be reported and every after the reporting she always summarizes the topics,1
we learned from his subject but not that much because there has no interaction between him and his students i think for this sy he only showed twice when he was being reported to the dean i hope that he will not handle any of our subjects next sem,-1
it is very fun having sir as our pe teacher because he is always active and every meeting before we start our class he always gives us energizer and he always makes us dance to wake up minds and not be bored on his class,1
studying rizal is very fun and interesting for me and i really got inspired by miss because she really knows the subject and she explains every details efficiently,1
sir dalinog is a very fun and very good teacher i had so much good time taking his class because he explains the topics very well and he also provides reallife examples and situations to us and he always told us to be openminded always,1
excellent true to his drive for excellence i wish all instructors are as excellent as mr taneo happy to have an instructor who really has a passion for lecture his efforts is highly appreciated unlike other instructors who resort to reporting,1
she is a caring and thoughtful instructor in our class and i definitely recommend her as the best,1
i also recommend this teacher since he is thoughtful and courteous to his students he would never stop talking until we fully comprehended what he was saying,1
she only gave us recorded session of her past discussions it is okay but it is much better if we do have live discussion so that if ever we have questions shell be able to answer when we have synchronous session she cant fully assist our concerns,-1
thank you,1
sometimes he dont consider some of the students concerns,-1
this is a lab subject deadlines from exercises is not applicable since we also have other classes to work on to forex during her period we are gonna watch the yt links provided then 23 exercises will follow and will due within the day,-1
having quizzes and exams in an ineffective manner such as 20 items quiz within 12mins only we can almost no longer read the questions and choices because of the limited time given,-1

she does not give solutions,-1
he gave long quiz on the day when we do not have synchronous or asynchronous classes,-1
she is a very considerate teacher,1
he gives a lot of additional information from each lesson,1
providing us only a video to learn and not attending to class,-1
naa koy ge always araa kay kausa raman sab mi ga meet like sa 1st day sa school year ron hahahaha struggle is real lods oy lisud kaayo sige ratag hinuktok sa video na iyang gesend way tudlotudlo ahk maka stress hahahaha,-1

good teacher,1
good teacher,1
good teacher,1
while miss montezon teaches effectively i think it is important that she gives clear instructions during examinations re formats and the like i also feel that my own understanding of the lessons is underappreciated because of her bookish rules,-1
he is very energetic and understanding,1
overall i love everything the way she teach students and her creative way to make us do some quizzes ive learned alot with her subject,1
he is very considerate,1
she is not considerate with her students she sticks in thinking that students are liars when it comes to giving excuses of failing to attend synchronous classes,-1
he is a very kind and gentle teacher,1
i really appreciate her the way she discussed the topics and its relatable she discussed very well only concern nko kay if naa mi questions if dli namo ma raise during synchronous and mauwaw ko sa gc is it okay maka message sa messenger thank you,1

dapat naay feedback sa mga activities dapat di mag sig tabi sa klase dapat tarongon gyud pag handle ang mga estudyante,-1
he doesnt attend his class he doesnt inform his students ahead of time he just leave activities but never discus it with the class,-1
dapat naay feedback sa mga activities dapat di mag sig tabi sa klase dapat tarungon og handle ang estudyante,-1
not about to be in class all the time,-1
she easily get annoyed,-1
miss please be fair sa uban students kay lisod baya ang klase miss niya online class is worse ug miss please usba na imong style nga naa kay favorite sa klase so please be fair,-1
hear our concerns miss dont let your ego be the center of this argument miss we know we are just students but dont use your profession to manipulate people especially students also pls provide answer key on every activity,-1
she is not motivating us sometimes she is so terrifying she would just rely on students stock knowledge i hope she would be better and motivate us,-1
only giving notes and exam theres no assignments activities or attendance how does our teacher compute our grades,-1
it is just and fair to actually ask the computation of your grades based on the components it involves we tried that during college and was given justice by our academic year adviser,0
shes a good teacher thank you for teaching us maam,1

she never allow us to ask questions while discussing her instructions on certain activities were not even clear and after discussing she will dismiss us without asking if we understand the lesson even her presentations of the topics were not organized,-1
sir dionysus is our teacher in hm 112 and hes very considerate kind and relatable i am really hoping that some teachers will admire him and use him as an inspiration to become great teachers,1
1 shes always not attending in our synchronous probably 34 weeks,-1
2 inconsiderate and very lazy teacher,-1
3 despite the fact that she rarely discusses the lessons she awarded us a poor grade,0
1 she doesnt even know how to use lms,-1
2 she prefers manual exams which is quite timeconsuming,0
3 shes inconsiderate,-1
4 shes very strict in terms of grades especially in essays which is quite opinionated yet she gave us a poor grade,-1
i thank you for being a good teacher and a role model youre the best sir,1
youre the best ms ato,1
this instructor was not able discussing virtually they always putting video in lms their have quizes and assign but it doesnt matter many og us complete complying his quizes and assign but mostly of my classmates are failed his subject,-1
i recommend her to use a ppt with any pictures on it so that the discussion is not boring,-1
i recommend that every discussion he must not give a us a bad mood because its affects us we will be pressured,-1
take time to consider students also we need more information about the topic that being discuss try also to listen with the students concern,-1
try to listen with the students concern,0
shes not so prepared when taking discussions it seems like shes not sure what her going say,-1
shes not that approachable and she conclude right away without knowing the side of the student,-1
he never handles students concerns and suggestions positively he never listens to our explanation and he will never consider any errors that the lms made he wants everything according to his rulesprinciples even though it is beyond the limit,-1
thank you sir,1
sir dont accept technicalities from us specially internet connecttion matter and he sometimes threaten us about the subject being so difficult and also discourage us to pass,-1
hes a great teacher interacts with us a lot and answer our questions related to the topic and he is also neutral not siding to anyone just giving fact informations love this teacher,1
sleeps during students reporting,-1
shes a great teacher,1
shes a wonderful teacher,1
the best teacher in p e he actually adpots the innovative learning for students,1
shes a good teacher and always facilitate and handle students well,1
i just want to say thank you to sir for teaching us new knowledge i have some concern na maybe sir will give us feedback to all tasks he graded why mao rana ang score namo for us to improve next tasks kay im little bit dismayed sa grade ive received,1
doesnt understand students struggles,-1
strict but in a good way,1
still the best teacher i have so far in online class keep on encouraging students to achieve their goals sir godblessed you sir,1
the best teacher in handling students issues regarding online classes and also including giving wisdom to us young students,1
i hope that maam could give another example that is clear and easily understand and not in the books only,-1
she is not openminded and shuts students valid reasons she attends class late and she does not consider technical difficulties even though were using these online platforms which happen to have problems itself,-1
i hope that maam could give feedback in my finished activities to know my mistakes and learn from them and also i hope that maam could give files and teach us that we can easily understand files that are complete before giving us some test,-1
too much work demanded in projects demands work similiar to our technocapstone project,-1
id have learned more in the class in udemy than in this class with this teacher,-1
i like the way he explains the topics because he can provide lots of examples and on how we deal with the problem,1
great teacher,1
great teacher shes strict but her strictness is not bad she asks about our concern and helps us with it,1
great teacher i am only her student on this subject aside from posting lms she also messages me personally if she sends me something,1
i can always reach out to her if i have any troubles or questions,1
she always listens and advises me,1
great teacher,1
she always listens and advises us,0
my problem with her is that even though we pass all our activities and have not missed us she still gave low grades,-1
great teacher shes kind and calm she always asks for any concern listens and helps us with it,1
he doesnt consider late activities due to bad connections or personal reason,-1
wont respond to any concern and will only tell the student that its our fault that we are late in passing the activity hope this will be taken action,-1
she is forgetful thats why we students get confused about her,-1
but overall she a good teacher she listen and help,1
sige rag chicka wala nay hapit ma discuss sa iyang handled subject,-1
he doesnt attend the class schedule regularly not even once he will just directly give quizzes without teaching the lesson and the youtube link doesnt help to understand a lesson,-1
he always say that kaya ra na ninyo kamo na lang tiwas when in fact we didnt even know how he basically discusses the diagram without a heads up on what is happening and his quizzes are different from his discussion,-1
i saw him once and that was the last during midterm period he only sent us youtube links to study and never discussed it,-1
makadagdag stress sa studyante kay sigeg pangasaba bsag wala mi moreklamo nga gagmay among grado i think she needs to control her emotions kasabot rako if tiguwang na sya but dli man sad maayo kasaban lng mi kay tungod ang pikas section nireklamo,-1

miss is really a knowledgeable considerable nice and kind teacher,1
mam daff is our least favorite teacher because she rarely attends to our classes and when she is planning to have a synchronous class it will always be postponed and will be moved to another date plus she is very inconsiderate,-1
there is one problem for me in her subject and its about the grades even if i got high scores on every quiz exam and assignments i still got 22 whereas some students that has missing outputs they got 20 even if those students rarely interacts 2class,-1
doesnt do any discussion and provides only a youtube link or recordings,-1
doesnt do any discussion taskactivities are not helpful let us perform the same thing over and over,-1

his not always present during assynchronous time he always gives us quizzes even if he hasnt discussed anything with us yet both synch and assynchis quizzes are too far from his lessonpowerpoint presentation im having hardtime in his subj,-1
as a teacher hes self centered and generally focuses on showing more glamorous and just shows off his gadgets whilst gloating mid lesson goes on tangents a bit too much as well,-1
no power points at all in the discussion always flexing expensive computer parts,-1
very good professor nice delivery of discussion and so comprehensive he always motivates students he often sends our gc a motivational quotes and i really appreciate it,1
always flexing and when he give a quiz the time is so short 40 items of 20 minutes what happened to the other students that have a slow internet connection,-1

his discussions were not aligned with the ilo he just discussed reallife scenariossituations which is okay but he must also teach us the legit topics of this subject,-1

she is very kind and is good at teaching,1
with all due respect i do not understand why our teacher in math 101 always sends a youtube link i clearly did not see his efforts in teaching us he may or may not be media literate but he can at least ask for help in making a powerpoint presentation,-1
she teaches very good i like her way of teaching because i can imagine the things shes talking about when shes giving real life examples i learned a lot from her,1
he is very kind and understanding to his students i can feel his passion for teaching as well as his compassion a good teacher,1

his quiz are so difficult since some of his quiz or test are not in his power point or in his discussion so all of my classmate including me have difficult to handle it and answer,-1
inconsiderate teacher doesnt accept that she is the one who commits the mistake instead pass it to her students even if it is obviously hers,-1
his lessons are out of the topic questions and assignments are recycled from his past subjects where i am also his student,-1
she is a good teacher who teaches well about her topic,1

good day sir caminade thanks for teaching us how to be responsible students kindly lower your standards sir because we are still students learning and studying also you are not only our subject and i hope you understand sir have a nice day sir,1
the teacher is actually good he knows what he is discussing however there are some topics that were not discussed but included during the quiz or exam and he gave unreasonable time limit example 40 items for only 20mins it is too much for the stude,1
i admire this teacher for she is determined in synchronous discussions however when i saw my grades i am not really satisfied with it because i complied my activities well and all of of them has perfect grades and scores but my grade didnt reached my,1
the time given for her quizzes are too short,-1
negative attitude and if we have a problem in her subject she will never intertained a student,-1
didnt consider the situation of the students didnt listen students concern about scores and learning discussion heshe feels always right he she offend the student like using vulgar words to offend student didnt listen students feedback,-1
she didnt listen our concerns in terms of our scores in quizzes and exam we are basing the book she provide but then again the answer in is not follows in the book she doesnt check manually the answer of the students shes not acting proffesional,-1
i admire his when he comes to class for his discussion is always clear and precise but what i dont like about is that he always gives us task us to do the reporting without evaluating our report i always wanted reporting but i also want to be corrected,1
i dont have a problem so far but i want a mastery and interaction whenever she discusses her lessons to see to it that her students understands the topic,1
my concern so far is that i want discussion specially in this subject mathematics because i am slow when it comes to understanding equations im having a hard time learning it on my own,0
since this is a major subject all i wanted is that a clear mastery of the topic and i suggest that exams should be given an ample time to ensure that students can answer all the required questions being asked,-1
so far so good,1
always talks,0
he didnt give a guide also have no attendance automatically give quizzes without the consent of the students,-1
maam doesnt know how to consider if my classmates have technical errors such as internet lagging dont know how to use share screen in our google meet she doesnt give chances that have a technical errorin our synchronous sessions she is often late,-1
sir has a great sense of humor when it comes to teaching,1
he is unique in teaching,0
we noticed that she was always late in knowing about the deadlines for the activities we will be aware of the exact deadlines in different departments we all know that the nstp has the same topics and deadlines for freshmen as well,-1
shorttempered gives us a very short amount of time for her quizzes impatient the way she answers our concerns are sometimes kind of rude,-1
good job hes always doing a great job,1
ok,1
sirrrr thank you for beinv patient with us,1
dili mo consider ug valid reasons dili maminaw ug hinaing sa estudyante,-1
dont pressure your student sir we know nga you dont care na ma hagbong ba mi or dili pero sabtanay lang ta sir nag sugod paman mi sa among learnings tapos gi pang hagbong na kay di ka abot sa imong standard fyi daghan na mo undang tungod sa imo sub sir,-1

he wil not accept those students who was late for only 3 mins even the consider late is 15 mins hell failed us in semi finals just because were late for only 3 mins,-1
will always disregard concerns from the students,-1
she is a good teacher and a strict one but for me she should understand and consider what the students problem or circumstances also we didnt understand her quiz or exam because some of her question dont have a further instruction,-1
need more students and teacher interaction,-1
he is a good teacher that everyone of us want his subject also he consider if we have a problem especially in internet connection,1
she handle the class properly and made the whole duration of class alive and enjoyable amidst how hard the subject is but sometimes she is not sure of what she had discussed which caused us confusion but overall she did great as an accounting adviser,1
he is indeed a great subject adviser he is considerate of todays set up and also during exams he also appreciate our efforts that is why i gave him a rating of 5,1
she is very passionate in teaching and she always have the vibe or presence that made the class alive she never have any absences indeed she is great that is why i gave her a rating of 5,1
he is very passionate and teaches is very well he is very considerate also that is why i gave him a rate of 5,1
the time given for every quizzes or exams are not enough there are times that we cant finish the quiz or take it because our connection is unstable or the lms is not working but she will not gave us any considerations even we have valid reasons,-1
not approachable,-1
not approachable,-1
always uptight with disciplinary methods and does not consider students concern on technical problems,-1
wala siyay attendance attendance unya dili pajud mag hatag activities mao na amo grado perti gagmaya,-1
he always talks about his life experiences and brags about his computer setup which i understand as an it student but it would be better if he spent his time discussing the topic rather than talking about irrelevant things thank you sir i appreciate,-1
hes a good teacher to us but he seems to have difficulties in delivering the topics to us and is very dependent to other teachers around him i hope to see him soon face to face thank you,-1
thank you miss i thought you were very strict at first but you are actually like a mother to us,1
thank you miss for understanding us your students when our connection is bad and also for teaching us wholeheartedly i appreciate you i promise to do better this time,1
shes inconsiderate with everything,-1
shes good at teaching but she was also inconsiderate to her students sometimes she gives too many assignments and quizzes to the point that we cant sleep the whole night making her given homework and seatwork,-1
she gave us such low grades that i cant even imagine whenever she has a quiz she only gives us a short time limit like 12 minutes for 15 items i cant even read the question fully but i am running out of time,-1
he was so good at teaching and i always had a great time during his time i am looking forward to our next virtual meeting for more fun and learning,1
his video recording is too long and it cost lots of data,-1
best teacher,1
thank you for everything maam youre a good teacher,1
her instructions are vague our task was about notetaking strategies she gave me a low score as per her i shouldve used the strategies that i put it was not in her instructions also notes must be simple and understandable to the one making it,-1
we cannot get his standard and always discussing items that will not come out during the test always showing off his setup and gaming items,-1
he has a high standards he give us 40 items in midterm with 20 minutes time with fill in the blank with case sensitive,-1
si sir panagsa ra magklase tagaan mi niyag notes if naay upcoming quizzes daghan notes ihatag gamay og items ang quizzes gamay sd time ihatag 15 mins for 15 items tagaan pa niyag password nya loading pa ang lms kawat na kaau sa time nga gihatag pait kaau,-1
maau kay motudlo c sir mabusog ka sa daghang makatonan present pjd always way masayang panahon,1
maau kay c sir klaro kaau maka discuss,1
smooth kay makadag klase c maam,1
thats for not telling us the instruction of your midterm exam,0
please consider our evaluation too,0
this teacher always showing off his set ups that we dont care because he want it to conclude to the topics weve been discussed to make the story short whenever he tries to discuss we always see him trying to make things substandard he dont give acts,-1
poor teaching skills,-1
very boastful about his pc always mentioning it every discussion even if it is not related to the main topic giving exams not in his time period and will not consider any excuses not recommended to teach again more students will suffer thank you,-1
always telling us how expensive his items and how he has many gadgets that are very expensive it takes for him 30 minutes to talk about that isnt in the topic giving exams not in his time and will not consider any excuses that we have,-1
poor teaching skills and discusses things that are not related to the lesson and examinations,-1
we are not a robot you dont give us any chance to explain why we cant attain to your class yet you always absent in our virtual meet we do not have any discussions since midterm exam your midterm exam is 40 or 45 items with 20 minuets allotted time,-1
he discusses it very well however his reference book seems to be in conflict with what he instructed he told us to buy an ebook because that will be our reference for every discussion but all the information discussed is mostly unfound in the ebook,-1
in regarding in teaching hes good but in dealing with his student feeling hes nothing also in giving the test very difficult and his notes is to long i cant really handle it because im not taking your subject only i got a lot,-1
this teacher is always flexing on devices and his ppt is not useful for incoming quizzesz and exams also in virtual meeting is inconsistent because he sometimes absent and if we are absent he dont give consideration on his students,-1
i just have one problemand that is his time limit for his examswe understand that he doesnt want us to cheatbut putting a time that is shorter than questions on the exams is not really okayit can put pressure on the studentseven if we did studywe c,-1
very kind and professional however he only teaches us very basic programming and proceeds giving us advanced programming activities only within his time we were quite pressured becoz 2 hrs isnt enough for us to solve his given problems with flowchart,1
he doesnt meet at the exact time or the exact day he only meets when he has a vacant time on his training which is kind of bad because he combined all the different activities and make thrm submit in a short period of time,-1
usahay ra mag klase d tarung mu tudlo sige ug pangasaba kusog mang hagbong d tarung mu tudlo,0
she never listens to some of our concerns and only gives feedback positively when shes not angry or in good mood she also ignore concerns when it was not sent to her accordingly even if it is an emergency,1
shes one of the great teachers i have,1
he only teach what he needs to and discuss it not so clearly and the way he teach is not that the students can absorb the teachings he do always discuss all the topic he prepared even he ran out of time and he always discuss in hurry,-1
he is a type of teacher that listens to himself only and dont give students consideration specially when theres some trouble in internet signals he dont accept reasons when his student is really lagging and gives only 10mins to answer our exams,-1
we didnt meet for a whole month time given for answering quizzes and exams are too short,0
he rarely attend our class and only a little teaching,0
sud para mangasaba,0
nya ginahan siya na ang answer siyang test kay pareha sa iyang mga notes na gihatag pero ang kabatian lang kong small letters tanan sa notes dapat small letters sad tanan sa imong answer dili pwede ang naay capital letters bisag usa,-1
an excellent teacher,1
he gave small amount of time to answer the quiz he gave to us for example a quiz is 40 items identification and we are only given 25 mins we cant answer in that amount of time due to low internet connection and the way he discuss is unexplainable,-1
this subject teacher is really strict to us he gave us difficulties to talk he gave us pressure and he even trash talk us and specially when were taking the quiz exams or whatever he only gave us not enough time and we cant finish answering it,-1
shes also a good teacher,1
she can be obviously observed as stressed and tired often times because of her child needs to improve regarding about her status as a mother and a teacher and she needs to be professional whenever shes needed to teach,-1
sometimes he is irritable whenever he asks for attention by frequently calling the class for a response otherwise a very good teacher when it comes to elaboration and critical thinking,-1
he has no issues in his teachings whatsoever but one concern would be that sometimes he is absent on most synchronous classes and rather gives asynchronous activities,-1
he is good but one noticeable characteristic would be that he is shy and often cannot interact with his us students he doesnt know how to explain further the topics and lessons and he needs to step up his teaching styles and methods,-1
he rarely meet us in google meet and he is always angry students are scared to approach him,-1
very engaging teacher but one issue would be that sometimes he cant thoroughly explain asynchronous activities,1
very big issue of him is that he doesnt illustrate the topics and lessons we often have no idea of the exercises and activities because he doesnt provide demonstration and only verbal explanation,-1
good job po maam for making us learned a lot,-1
,0
a very pleasant teacher although most of the time he doesnt know how to engage students to discussion and most of the time he rather talks to himself,1
,0
great job teacher,1
please sir make youre time limit quizes and major exams a bit longer its the reason why i got bad grade in this grading i hope you make an action about this,1
thak you miss god bless,1
a very problematic teacher always absent illtempered irrelevant teachings and frequently gives quizzes and tests without discussions he needs to improve student interaction as he is very intimidating and distrustful,-1
lesson about general things about computers chapter 1 yet discusses specifically to gpus series and price discussions are rarely relevant to the quizzes or intended learning outcome,0
kusug musabot nga maestra bisan gamay kog grado niya,0
sir can you please expand the way you teach because i can barely caught up with the topic and i had no experience with programming language,1
the best teacher that i have i learned so much lesson on her subjects,1
he is very intelligent but the way he teaches his students is not as effective as the other teachers hed put pressure on the students and most of us cannot cope up with his lessons,-1
,0
she is good in discussing especially giving an idea about on how to be a successful entrepreneurs in the future,1
this teacher should be promoted already or what even though he is not feeling well he always try to attend classes and his efforts are greatly appreciated i admire him not because of the way he teaches his students but how he is very considerate,1
most of the time during meet he only gives ppt rather than discussing the topic,0
he is a good professor even though he didnt discuss or attend our synchronous class i havent learned his class to be honest he did not give an update that theres an activity or seatwork that he put on lms,1
we learned so much about his subject he was a great teacher he has a sense of humor he do jokes sometimes while he discuss to not us getting bored great teacher,1
all i can say is thank you to this instructor because we learned her so much in life she is a good at discussing and also super humble amd understanding many of my classmate likes her so much,1
he provides 75 items per hr in semifinals pressure since we need to click the next button in every item clicking it would steal 3 secs in every items imagine 3x75items225secs or 4mins previous exams and quiz was fine but in semi its oppressive,-1
as of this moment my grades in her subject still didnt appear in the students portal,0
i hope you change your mindset when youre internet is slow its not our fault when we are choppy on your end please be considerate not everyone has a high speed internet connection i hope students wont experience this so change,1
overall i like the teaching of mr apostol for the reason that he handle his duty as instructor very well the students always has learnings every online class sessions,1
overall i have experienced limited online class session with this teacher i dont know what his reason but he attended his class rarely,-1
ms gallo always attending her online class even asynchronous class she still conduct virtual class to us and it is okay for me for the reason that me and my classmate has a room for improvement in our class discussion due to her eagerness for us to lea,1
overall i like the way mr gutierrez teaching skills but sometimes he has that attitude that other might be misunderstood like the way he handle the class he is always make us feel disappointed about ourself based on our performance,-1
in terms of teaching he is very proficient however as one of his student we were very hesitant to tell why we couldnt delay to take the exam please be considerate enough everyone is adjusting in this new normal be the source of motivation,1
one of the best teacher he inspired and aspired us to continue life despite of this new normal,1
very efficient and effective instructor considerate and patient fair enough to handle students whereabouts,1
i like the way she teach but sometimes she ignores the concerns of her students,-1
overall the teaching of miss montezon shows professionality by attending and teaching her students with mastery of her field,-1
ms ynot is a great teacher based on my experienced during our virtual class sessions,1
hes teaching is great ive learn a lot about our topic,1
mr tesorio is great teacher and i believe his students gain a lot of knowledge due to his professional teaching,1
mr alo is a great teacher and thats what i observed,1
thank you for teaching us we love you,1

very good maam keep it up,1
very good doc keep it up,1
no discussion ever since she gave birth but what we did was to understand her but we dont deserve this kind of grade i personally passed all the activities she gave to us yet i receive an unbelievable grade,1
his not act like a teacher he never listen to our concerns he never provide us a powerpoint presentation so that we have guide,-1
he never let the students explain their research proposal and when the students will not explain he would say that they do not understand the research well another is that he always disappoints the students by saying words of discouragement,-1
he is a great mentor towards his students he has a good sense of humor which is a good thing since it prevents the student to feel boredom during the discussion,1
she is quite inconsiderate when it comes to giving us tasks she tend to give us a lot of tasks at the same time remember nstp is not the only subject we take in quizzes exams she expected us to answer 4 topics up to 30 items in 20 minutes,-1
mo gamit og oras nga dili iyaha,0
he attend to our synchronous sessions once in a blue moon and rarely discusses our topic,0
he rates low grades even though i got good scores in quizzes and exams and even passed the given tasks earlier to the deadline i dont know his grading system is but this should be address seems like my efforts are useless,-1
i really admire this teacher because she has her own ways of making her students understand in a very simple way also this teacher is very approachable and is very cheerful which makes us her students to come always into her class,1
this teacher is approachable listens to the opinions of her students but sometimes has lots of seminars that makes her absent on our class,0
i dont know if it is just me and my friend that dont sometimes really understand how she is giving us the lessons because we hardly cant answer all those activities she had given us because of lack of information about the said lesson,1
such a very nice and good teacher always handles her students with confidence a great attitude and is very jamming but very good in making students understand the lesson,1
great attitude very professional in his job lets his students understand the lesson easily for he is equipped and studies lesson very well so that the delivery is smooth and can be understandable over all a great teacher,1
great teacher understands every student and gives lesson smoothly thats why it is easy to understand,1
he should be more engaging with students because his way of teaching does not benefits students because his subject is very complex and there should be more examples during the discussion he should slow down the pace of teaching each lesson,1
he just only flexing what he have and he gave us 40items with 25mins of time answering the midterm exam and we didnt see his face in every meetings he always off his cam,0

hes very considerate and not strict i enjoy listening to his discussion,1
mahadlok ko nimo gamay misspero overall nindot ka modiscuss miss and im sorry miss if di jud dayn ko gets automatic but rest assured po na ako jud na studyhan ang topic para mas ka gets ko magsearch kog more sources para mas magets nako,-1
one of my fave teachers very understanding kaayo,1
sometimes she will not discussed and gives activity directly,0
i dont understand what he discussed because he jumps off the topic,0
she explains the lesson very well,1
thank you sir for being such a considerate instructor to us you are one of the best instructor for me we truly appreciate your kindness sir 3,1
shes good at explaining the topic she gives feedback with all of my activities through email,1
she explains the topic very well,1
no feedbacks on our exercises and we arent aware if we did the exercise correctly since this is a laboratory subject it is very important to always have feedbacks or an evaluation if students really understand the topic thank you,1
the way she delivers the lessons is not that effective because it somewhat happens that she is not sure about her statements she always stutter and i hope she will avoid the word kanang koan basta unsa na and the like to improve her delivery skills,1
lisod kaayo si sir activity nya is mga case study akong answer bisag taas na kaayog explanation wala pa nako gikuha gikan google like gikan gyud sa akoa mga ideas dili gyud dako ang grade grabi kaayo ka gamay as in galisod gyud ko ni sir dakoon grde,1

please we dont have access to the same internet speed the quizzes only limits to few minutes with more number of items it is not because we could not search through google but the internet does not usually cooperate please we need more time,1
well balanced teacher he is good in teaching but in giving activities is slightly difficult than the topic discuss,1
less hassle,0
she is always one hour late in our meeting she always discuss hurriedly in an oral participation she always not consider low internet connection and doesnt give a chance to a student offend my classmates life status does not check attendance,-1

i love sir pineda teach us hoping he still out instructor in nstp next semester,1
thank you for being understanding teacher,1
every class time of him i can feel it that im attending a pe class because of his energy,1
we cant communicate her properly and cant notice the time that shell start classes plus one time most of us students in my section hadnt done her performance task which was a dialogue she said to us to do it next week but didnt done what she said,0
he is one of the best teacher that ive know in my entire life words definitely cant explain how amazing he is as a teacher may you continue inspiring us sir danilo,1
miss hernando is a good teacher the way she teaches aids in my understanding of the subject she uses a white board in discussion which aids in learning more the method maam hernando teaches is similar to a facetoface class i am grateful to my teach,1
he rarely come to class or held a synchronous session also he always flexing the gadgets that he has and the time he has given us on our midterm test is very short can u imagine 20mins for 40 items fill in the blank question i mean thats overkill,0
a very thoughtful teacher who understands hisher students circumstances and gives lessons and tests that we can understand a teacher who has a positive attitude towards hisher students i am very grateful to have a teacher like her to teach us,1
i am grateful to have maam rosamaria us our pe since she always gives effort on teaching us on our performance in class she is both a strict and kind teacher that balances both direct and indirect feedback keep up the good work maam,1

maintain the attitude of being an approachable teacher god bless you always miss,1
the only problem is that she doesnt understand some of the students circumstances like for example i am a working student but she just doesnt understand my situation and just pulls me down thats the only bad characteristic she has,-1
maam rosalyn is a teacher who always greets the students every morning about how theyre doing and wakes them up in a positive way a cheerful teacher who gives enthusiasm in the morning teaching us about nstp lessons,1
a teacher who is good at teaching students about his subject the 1 problem is that the synchronous session time is too small but i have no problem with its just that i want to learn more from me in synchronous sessions rather than asynchronous,-1
the problem is that he is too fast in teaching that some students cannot catch up even though he knows that some of us didnt even take it as a senior high course and doesnt have knowledge about coding overall all needs to slow down in teaching,-1
a typical teacher u see everyday the only problem is that she needs to clarify the subjects we needs to report in details since she always gives incomplete and gives us negative comments and also she doesnt know how to control her emotions,-1
its unfair to fail a student just because he wasnt able to buy a book when he was able to comply to all of the assigned activities just saying,-1
find it intricate to watch the specific videos more often i would like to have stepbystep made easy tutorial videos summary but most importantly i am grateful for miss siegas understanding sympathy and compassion thank you miss siega,1
one important concern is that we are confused in terms of his classroom grading system on the other side i am very grateful to have sir xiong as our foreign language teacher because he is passionate and understanding thank you so much sir xiong,1

for the course my concern is to give us enough time in taking the quizzes and exams in the lms i think 40 minutes is not enough for a 35item long questions but overall sir sumagpao is a good teacher thank you so much sir,1
i guess hopefully shell understand that students need a break too and that not everybody is solely focused on her subject and that other students are also busy being a breadwinner at the same time not everybodys solely focused on online class,1
all i can say is hopefully hell start adjusting and coping up with the students as well not everybody is a genius,-1
the best,1
sometimes he doesnt discuss the topic fully and instead he sometimes brag about his gaming equipment notes are sometimes delayed gives small amount of time to the exam and schedules it on a day which is not our schedule,-1
keep inspiring students doc you are one of the best teachers that i encountered,1
this teacher is rarely to be seen and when he said to join the class the handler is not him the guidance,1
keep on inspiring students maam,1
this teacher is the best among the best thank you for being such an awesome teacher to us maam you deserved the perfect scores,1

our sir always speaks deep english that sometimes we cannot understand what he is saying,0
my professor always acknowledge our concerns and inquiries she also understands and take immediate corresponding actions every time she did a great performance thanks miss christian mae,1
i hope sir knows next time that we dont know everything so we have to be taught to know i hope he doesnt assume that we already know the topic we cant understand the topic because of that,1
she provides quizzes that has 15 20 items and she only gives us 1215 minutes and she always act like shes in a hurry i dont want to attend her class because she pressures students,0

that way he teach and treat us is like were 3rd or 4th year students even though were 1st year students and also he doesnt accept any types of reasons even if its valid or invalid especially when it comes to the internet connection,1
the definition of a great teacher,1
a great considerate and interactive teacher,1
he sure does know how to teach but gives unbearable workloads and sometimes inconsiderate a good teacher though,1
a teacher with so much consideration and has empathy to students keep him in the university hes a gem,0
the best teacher in the semester a very considerate caring and all positive adjectives you can name that is mr sapanta for you,1
a very caring and considerate teacher,1
one of the best teachers in the semester she knows how to interact and connect with her students,1
a good teacher but gives too much workloads and quizzes,1
too much workloads but can really teach well,1
he gives too much school works which will require us on focusing in his subject to the point where we get drained and burnt out,-1
his standards are so high even if we followed the rubrics in the activity still were having a hard time to get a high score in the pts some quizzes were not mentioned in the lesson the reason why were getting low grades even if we study before test,-1
she really does her job well and is very diligent to her schedules the only concern is that to refrain from telling to recall previous topics since not all of us had the privilege to not stop studying because of the pandemic like me who had 2yrs to stop,1
some quizzes arent in the ppt,0
she does her job well and she is very resourceful with the topics and considerate to her students the only small concern is the speed of topic delivery overall she is well aware and knows a lot to her topics,1
she delivers well with fluency on her classes the thing is she needs to be familiar with her students not only a chosen few and avoid favoritism she needs to be patient and considerate and lastly to be generous enough in grading her students,1
she does well in her job it reflects how experienced she is in teaching the small concern is that some or maybe in rare occasions the testsexams didnt match with what was that but overall she is the best teacher we had for both math and chem so far,1
she delivers with fluency and mastery of her topics the small concern is that she should be atleast a bit generous in grading her students but overall shes doing her job well,1
i am not in favor with miss marites abundiente knowing that she does not accept any comments pertaining to our concerns she does not open her heart and mind as a human that we do have a lot of things to do as well,-1
i do appreciate sir nicomedes lumontad knowing that he will do things that can make his students understand the topic effectively keep it up sir,1
as a major subject it really gives me excitement from how our teacher interact with us,1
i am thankful of how miss edeza handles us because she is so considerate and understanding in our very own concerns,1
sir danilo is a very passionate teacher he recalls us one by one even if it could lose his voice thank you sir,1
there were times when she didnt recognized that she was mistaken and there was an error in the quiz she gave which really affected our score and grade we couldnt answer some of the questions in the quiz since there was no correct answer in the choices,-1
he discussed to us 34 times only ever since he gave 1 quiz 1 activity prelim but no midterm yet he gave us a grade which we really dont deserve i hope this will be addressed and you will take actions for this,-1
hes a great teacher he didnt pressure us in everything and made sure that his activities could be handled by us easily hes also entertaining,1
i love the way she teaches our synchronous discussion because shes prepared well and elaborates the topic miss hernando is an active teacher and very understandable regarding some concerns,1
he made us discuss all the topics which was really hassle in our part since we are new to some topics and we had to watch on youtube tutorials and make research that cost a lot of time and we have more activities to finish from other subjects,0
shes a nice teacher she explained the discussions very well and clearly i really did understand everything she discussed however its sometimes hassle in our part since she gives 3 activities every week although it could be submitted next week,1
sir jose pineda is the very energetic teacher ever,1
there were times that he said vulgar words and threw green jokes which made us uncomfortable he also allowed my other classmates to throw inappropriate jokes,1
excellent performance,1
maam cameron is one of my favorite teacher because shes nice i will rate miss cameron 5,1
she is the perfect professor to have teach the subject as she has mastery towards it,1
he is sometimes sarcastic regarding some of my concerns even though i am asking him politely but only sometimes but all in all he is an effective and efficient instructor i learned so much from him thank you,1
we never seen his face although he has a nice voice that can really catch out attention he sometimes give us advices that contradict our feelings he is really a good teacher tho,1
a great teacher showed us the beauty of online class and the beauty of lms,1
sometimes i cant understand her discussion 4,0
he rarely appears on our classes and he doesnt interact with his student,0
only reads the topic without explaining or giving examples,-1
miss expound the discussion 5,-1
a great teacher with a love to her passion,1
hes okay naman,1
he is always absent and irresponsible that he lost 3 of our reflection inputs he is very bias and has favorites in our class that he only call in recitations the students he likes also he didnt gave make up quiz for students with valid reasons,-1
he keeps on relating god to his topics i thought uc is a non sectarian university,1
she doesnt discuss the topics herself she lets the students discuss it always,0
through uploading video is not enough for us as a students to learn we need also the present to our teacher because sometimes we cannot easily cope up the lesson since the internet will slow and we cannot easily watch the video,-1
5,0
4,0
well done miss,1
i really like maam jocelyn tampon she does so good in her subject and she portrays like a real science genius i learned so much from her and her discussions are very clear and understandable shes a fair teacher too i give her 100 out of 100,1
i love miss diane she is kind within her student she motivated me in ways,1
good day miss unta inig pass namos among activity kay unta dili public thank you,1

keep it up sir lodiiiiiiii,0
she prepares a schedule of activities ahead and posts it in our lms i think it appropriately guided the students throughout the semester she answers any of our concerns and is always considerate,1
based on my experience miss lea is a great teacher she is very understanding and considerate and whenever someone in our class will have a concern she will entertain it professionally i learned a lot from her subject that is applicable to real life,1
thank you sir nicomedes,1
thank you so much sir,1
dako kaayung pasalamat sa imong pagkatarong ug pagkamaayung instructor you valued time always godbless sir and be safe always,1
thank you sir danilo you are my favorite teacher in history youre the best,1
great teacher gives you the feeling of not being scared by asking questions to him he is very professional in his work and creates a wonderful mood every classes,1
in my experience sir lumontad is a good teacher he teaches us in the simplest way he can and the way he gives grades is just satisfying,1
a very approachable teacher professional in his work and shows us his mastery in his subject,0
in my experience sir ababon is a very calm teacher he always teaches us in a simple way he never gave us headaches even if the subject is math lastly i learned a lot from this subject,1
he provides detailed discussions but he is unapproachable and does not cater to any concerns from students regarding internet connection and attendance he uses quizizzcom and conducts a 20item test statement 1 and statement 2 type for 8 mins only,0
sir dennis is not a good instructor and he always pressures us everytime he gave us quiz,-1
a kindhearted teacher very approachable,0
i like her as an instructor even though sometimes i dont understand some of her discussions because shes too fast at explaining the topics but shell ask us if we get the topic so its fine,1
he shows his mastery in his subject and teaching skills is awesome because its easy to understand,1
a great kind and loving teacher he handles the subject very professionally he is also very approachable,1
in my experience im slowly disliking this teacher because he never announces us beforehand that we will have a quiz on his next meeting inshort he often surprises us with a quiz and for me the way he uses sensitive words is just inappropriate,-1
a kind teacher who makes the lectures easy to understand he also shows mastery in his subject,1
sir lumontads ways of teaching are very interesting and we enjoy them so much,1
he is strict but in a good way he makes student to have a better understanding about their behaviors and he shows mastery in his subject,1
maam needs to have more visual aid on discussing her topic,0
he shows mastery in his subject he is also very approachable,0
in my experience miss rosamaria is a good teacher however she is somehow inconsiderate i dont know whats the reason behind his inconsiderateness but at least she should be considerate sometimes because not all are having a great life,1
favorite teacher hehe,1
for me sir falcon is the teacher that i would love to be my teacher for the next semesters if possible because he is very expert in teaching like this subject understanding the self also he never gave us headaches and i learned a lot from him,1
i kinda wish that the quiz and test are not short 15ish min quizzes and 25ish min tests are too short some test requires me an hour to finish but half an hour very difficult its like a speed test it would be nice 2530 min quizzes and 1hr tests,1
in my experience maam marites is a kind of strict teacher for me she is intimidating and the way she gave grades to us is low and its just sad that many of us were academic scholars and aiming for good grades,-1
in my experience maam arcipe is a good teacher but she is a kind of inconsiderate teacher she never accepts excuses any form of excuses and barely discusses the topic and instead she made groupings and made us have group reporting,-1
in my experience sir is a very good teacher he is very calm and he never gave us headaches he is very considerate and understanding,1
please give the activity or assignment in exact time and schedule thank you,1
i greatly appreciated maam because even though she is not feeling well like her throat aches because of the whole day of teaching she still discusses the topic in detail making sure that we learned and understand the topic well,-1
i love the consistency of this teacher because she didnt miss any class schedule that we have starting the sem until now but during her discussion sometimes we get bored because there is no engaging technique to make the student become attentive,1
gives quizzes twice a week that most of time the content of the quizzes dont relate to his previous discussions,0
often forgot that its our asynchronous session because she still meet us sometimes twice have different ways of having quizzes and some are effective but some arent,1
all the topic in our sem is reported by students she didnt summarize or give additional information on the given topic that is why im confused that the content in our exam is not tackled in the reporting or the notes she gave,-1
hes good at instructing us and in discussions but sometimes it gets boring because of all the talking that somehow not related to the part of the topic and gives super hard activities that takes a lot of our time,1
often forgot to post the said task she assigned hahha but shes really fine,1
i have nothing to say shes an excellent teacher,1
ggwp,0
less interaction seldomly addresses our concerns theres sometimes mismatch between his content of ppt lessons and the items of quizexam,0
she didnt have her class sometimes during our synchronous class her discussion is very confusing and sometimes her environment is noisy our topic is not discussed properly which is why we are having a hard time during her exam thank you,-1
sometimes we have no class on saturday that is why we are left behind on the topics and activities the way sir teach us is indeed amazing no doubt but the problem is that in his place internet connection is not stable,-1
this subject is engaging and interactive i am really excited always about this subject,1
he never know how to teach,0
the irritating approach of correcting his class,-1
time is always wasted because of the rants that may sound like a mere reminder to him,-1
an aggressive and demanding tone of voice,-1
inaccurate instructions for his activities in lms,0
inconsiderate,-1
overall he is a good teacher that really knows his profession he gives life lesson that i can surely tresure for life,1
he is a very responsible and approachable teacher,1
sir jose has been an excellent educator for me so far he has been a fun and professional teacher aiding us the necessary information that we college students should learn,1
miss ato has been a great educator even though her subject is math a difficult one she teaches us in a way that we can easily understand and retain that knowledge for a long period of time she is great at communicating and empathizing with students,1
sir allan has always been considerate to his students and we know for a fact that he cares about his discussions he teaches passionately and elaborates his lessons in the most effective and interesting as possible,1
hes very approachable and friendly teacher he always ask hows our day every time we are having synchronous,1
she is the type of teacher that is inconsiderate she doesnt accept our reasons if sometimes we failed to take her quizzes because of internet connectivity in which we have no control with even her can experience that as well,-1
sir romagos was very nice and easy to approach,1
i can learn easily with maam suello she gives reasonable activities and quizzes and a considerate teacher i hope she will still be my teacher in my major subjects in succeeding years in accountancy,1
ms gloria is truly a great educator however her students cannot learn effectively on her ways of teaching because she instills fear students often get anxious by just attending her classes because she is somewhat difficult to please,1

she is more on reporting but shes not totally discussed a certain topic but i think shes really smart teacher,1
maam cuevas is so good in teaching she knows her lessons very well and she engage with her students also she has favoritism in our class she only chooses to reply to a certain student when we ask something shes unclear with her instructions,1

shes doesnt appreciate our effort she thinks our answers are all from google when in fact it is not i answer her questions with the best that i can do from quizzes assignments and orals but it wasnt appreciated well she asks too much,-1
one of the bests thank youuu and god bless youuu,1
she has a favoritism in our class when i asked about a concern about our activity she didnt care to answer i waited for days there was no response but when this particular student is the one asking she responds immediately follows all her suggestions,-1
hi sir good day mayta mo hatag kag taas nga oras mag pa take ug examquiz namo kanang time nga fit sa number of items na imohang ipa answer namo ug unta next time think before you speak kay usahay sir maka offend na imohang storya,1
hes my teacher for two semesters and ive got nothing else to say to him except hes a great teacher gives high grades and listens to our concerns i hope all teachers are like him,1
she just relies on youtube most of her learning materials are youtube videos that she doesnt even discuss to us sometimes her discussions is confusing shell just read whats written on her ppt and now shes more impatient and inconsiderate,-1
hi sir thank you kay wala ra ka libog na professor masinabtanon kaayu ka sa amoa maayu unta e bless pa ka maayo ni lord god bless and keep safe always,1
good day mam may unta next time mo construct ka ug question nga masabtan namo ug tarung mam,1
our efforts were not given justice she gave us low grades she thinks that all of our answers are from google which is not true she rarely accept students suggestions gives lots of activities but with a short time limit only not enough for students,-1
one of the bests thank you and god bless you maam,1
favoritism is evident she doesnt appreciate effort and it was not given justice ive done everything that shes given and it doesnt reflect on the grades that she gave me sometimes she is having a difficulty with her lessons and we didnt complain,-1
she doesnt know her lessons well the way she discuss is not convincing she only reads whats written on her presentation and couldnt expound some topics but shes fair and appreciates students effort,1
maam kon magpa report ka please lang pag hinay2 kay dili man mi flash tawn tas palihog sag consider gamay maam kay di man mi perpek na pagka studyante tas ikaw sad maam dili ka perpek,-1
i dont understand most of her discussions and most of the time only let us watch videos from youtube doesnt give value to the concerns raised anymore she has become strict compared to the way she handles the class before,-1
shes being unfair when it comes to oral recitations and giving of grades accepts a students answers but doesnt ask others so that we can alsohave a chance to give our thoughts about a topic efforts were not given justice in our grades its very low,-1
she shows no mastery in topics she discusses sometimes gives us activities that are complicated or difficult to find like articles on the other hand shes fair and gives high grades,1
dili siya kaayo muhatag ug consideration like nadugay lang gamay ug present sa report due to internet connection or na lag ba walaon na dayun,0
and when it comes sa among reporting permi siyang magdali,0
indeed the best teacher so far in the college department he motivates me to love history more than ever he is not just a teacher but he is also a listener to us students wishing him the best for his future endeavors,1
dili siya kabalo mo consider sa mga students nga kabalo man unta tang tanan na lisod jud ni atung set up karun especially when it comes to internet connection kay dili tanan accessible permi then lack pud siyag discuss namo,-1
she has a good teaching skills and naka apan lang daghan kaayo ug activites ipanghatag hehe,1
sir lomuntad is impressive and has a good sense of humor,1
she sometimes says bad words during the class sometimes murag bugal2 iyang klase when you ask about your grades its like she thinks youre questioning her credibility when in fact youre just asking why reporting reporting reportiing and reporting,-1
thank you sir for all your patience and hard work stay safe and god bless,1
unquestionably a good teacher and we can learn so much from her but shes like looking down on her students like murag gi bogoan siyas iyang students samot nas mga wala kay niya nailhan she did not directly said that but she made us feel that way,1
its more like our teacher is youtube instead of her always showing us videos instead of discussing us the lessons herself and we dont even understand something,1
shes always dependent on youtube so maybe we shouldve enrolled there since its becoming our new classroom shes so maldita and sooo sooo unapproachable and she rarely discusses the lessons but she gives reasonable grades unlike sa uban diha hmm,0
a good teacher i can see that shes trying her best to teach us so many things,1
best teacher ever hes good at what hes doing super buotan but in a way that we still respect him so much hes not intimidating teaches us so much sana all teachers same ni sir please give sir ryan a salary raise or promote him hes the best of all,1
he is a good and excellent teacher,1

thanks for being considerate sir unta ikaw gihapon ang mohandle namo inig la fl 104 next sem puhon,1
i suggest the teacher should give us reallife situation examples when the discussion starts also the assessmentsquizzes should be related to the topiclesson,0
exceptional teacher,0
shows up 40 minutes late to the class and never updates if there will be a synchronous class or not this led to students not being able to perform the oral recitation because we thought there will be no class because the teacher is always very late,-1
i hope she will not rely the students to discuss the topic it is better that she herself would discuss the topic so that it can be understood because it is totally different when teachers would be the one to present the topics,1
she did not give her instruction clearly with that it can lead to the students confusion,1
try to meet your students even once a week so that they can interact the topics students couldnt appreciate the videos you send because some videos you send is not yours,-1
try to show your students that they have this subject not only giving them a plates,-1
thank you,1
indeed he is a good teacher and he always motivate us to strive harder,1
try to give us discussion even in 1 time,0

one of the most approachable and considerate instructor since day one and she deliver every topic she discuss very well,1

the best teacher hes very understanding soft kind hearted intelligent and the way he handle the class were like no pressure at all but i know we all gain lot of knowledge about this subj because all his example were very easy to understand,1
she improved herself during this online class unliked before facetoface shes sometimes not attending the class snd always giving us a lot of activities and do theresearch and which is not good because shes always been our major teacher until now,1
thank you miss suello,1
thank you and god bless always,1
online class setting might be the biggest factor why the instructor is not able to give his best and might also be the reason why us students are not satisfied with the situation,1

goods,1
keep it up,1
he is the best and my favourite teacher he really an approachable person and he consider his students concerns he always ask confirmation if we understand the lesson and he make sure that everyone participated in the class best teacher indeed,1
i really like this teacher especially on her creative visual aids and questions however i dont like part when she is using youtube videos to explain in class sometimes and her exams as well are beyond our discussion it is very hard,1
this teacher keeps on giving activities even if the time is late like she gives assignments or activities 3 am in the midnight,1
she is a very nice teacher and i really like when she used reallife examples also she gave us new knowledge however sometimes in making activities her instructions are not clear and well elaborated,1
she is one of the best teachers especially in elaborating her discussion so well however during exam or submitted requirements theres no feedback or even scores i dont know where or what i need to improve to get good grades from her,1
this teacher keeps on giving activities quizzes and assignments even though its not her time she keeps on demanding activities that makes the students tend to get confused on whether what to answer first,-1
she is one of the sweetest and good teacher for me however she uses youtube videos on her discussion which i really dont like i prefer also that she will be the one to discuss the lesson not the video reporting by my classmates,1
she is a very good teacher for me she make sure that all of us participated and she recognise our effort during oral recitation she tried her best to conduct her lesson even if there are some problems internet connection during our class,1
she is so bias in class she keeps on choosing students who are close to her she wouldnt mind choosing other students from the class,-1
everytime this teacher attends on class sometimes she wears sleeveless that is not appropriate for the class plus the fact that she oriented us not to wear those kind of close whenever were on synchronous time plus this teacher is bias,-1
she so strict and i never see her smile since we met and because of that we so scared she give us a lower grade and i dont know why we all do our best but thats not enough to her,-1

it seems he has no interest in opening his camera weve met virtually several times but as usual he didnt turn on his camera,1
absolutely a good teacher even though shes so strict but she always make sure that at the end of the discussion we can really adopt and relate the topics in our real lives,1
with regards to my concerns about my midterm grade he didnt not reply my chat in facebook and even in the lms i am not really satisfied with his grades because i know that i have passing scores in quizes and exams but it seems that he gave low grades,-1
he often give us quiz without any discussion he rarely meet us thats why during exams or quiz we dont have idea of what would be the possible questions because he didnt discuss about that topic he gave low grades even though he didnt do discussions,-1
very satisfactory performance,1
he teaches well i just hope that he could discuss combined with interactions with the students to know if they really get the topic above all great teacher,1
he teaches well i just do hope that he can discuss the topic in a manner that caters everyones learning capabilities knowing that some of the students need a bit more time in maths above all great teacher,1

thank you for being approachable and considerate,1
i doesnt deserve the grade she give me i deserve something higher that i think would fit my ability because those students whos higher that me often asked answer from me and the the benefits it its shows how unfair the system,1
the vrds being posted dont coincide with the examquizzes i mean there is always a twist and when i solve the problem theres something missing that was not tackled in the vrds and i always find myself shocked when i take the exam pero laban,-1
the fact that the subject is great but her way of teaching is not is utterly disappointing the way she teaches is very monotonous and boring she gave us piles of projects and still gave us low grades we dont feel her enthusiasm or presence at all,-1

ms chuchi even though she is strict she wants the students to learn and have something to learn for the future,0
favorite teacher,1
all i can say she teach very well i love the way she delivered the discussions,1
i love how he tells real life stories just to make sure we could understand the lesson he is very organized when it comes to teaching and professional as well,1
i commend your teaching style sir i did learn everything from your efforts and i must say you are incredible hope to see you again sir keep up the good job,1
i know he is very smart when it comes to discussions of lessons but every session or virtual meet is very boring and plain i wont demand about his mastery on taxation topics but its just students gets bored withbhis plain voice and the way he teach us,-1
great teacher,1
her quizzes are confusing and the mistakes on the checking of quiz that we had discussed on her was abandoned by her she would say i will work on that but at the end of the period shes still not able to change that which makes us have lower grades,-1
such an appreciative teacher i love how she handle the class,1
how you teach did really give me a great perspective on the subject although i just want to suggest if your solving a problem with the class provide a presentation for us to catch up especially those like me that cant apprehend by just listening,1
sometimes he would use our section to just rant about her other classes during our virtual class which i think brings bad vibes and he would get mad with the unfollowed instructions which actually wala naman talaga siyang instruction na ganun,-1
personally speaking i think you should calm down often or maybe do be interactive with your students not threaten them with intermittent attitude because we somehow discourage ourselves to delve on your subject that much,1
he always gets mad easily with small things and what he do while hes mad is very scary for me one time he scolded one of our classmates and he tell her discouraging words which i think is very offending,-1
we would always experience difficulty in answering activities because her instructions are always confusing,-1
shes very smart and i love her really as a teacher she motivates us in a positive way so far she was the best teacher for me this semester,1
hi miss i am really fond of your frolicsome behavior while discussing although i hope you can reduce saying bahala namo class or kagets ra mo oy or always bring about our shs memories because not all can recall their experiences quickly,1
prelims and midterm period activities are very much difficult she would not discuss it simplier just to make us understood reallym but all in all i love her the way she motivates students and with her messages in our google chat,1
the way she intervene to the reporters discussion is very offending for me,-1
please refrain from not admitting students before the agreed time kay you said 10 minutes ang span to join pero dili naka mang accept wa pa kaabot og 10 minutes and then please show mastery to what you discuss because the subjects too technical for us,1
a good teacher always discuss in a synchronous sched gives assignment in asynchronous class gives a nice grades,1
i hope sir you stick to discuss all whats in the book tungod man gud sa imong pagambak2 dili nami kaapas unya recording pa jud sir another sorry to point out but youre hypocrite when you want us to open our cameras when you dont even reveal yours,1
theres nothing much to say youre engagement on teaching towards us is praiseworthy,1
keep up the good work sir thank you,1
please miss do check the formulation of your quizzes and exams because there are many discrepancies each time we take and if we address them all its either you ignore it or not care at all resulting to much less grades more than what we really deserve,-1
maybe sir you can discuss with further examples and not use entire english honestly i did not always understand what youre trying to demonstrate and it frustrates me please dont read the entire time and explain well the topics for us to catch up,1
among all my subject i can say that mr ramagos is the most understanding prof he always gives us chances whenever we miss an activity,1
shes very inconsiderate i understand that we are all adjusting from this online platform but even at small things like 5 minutes late she wont accept it anymore shes very strict and inhumane,-1
i like this teacher in a way i have learn something in every discussion an approachable considerate teacher to his student,1

he cant accept students who has valid reasons to be absent even if your signal is bad and you are delayed while explaining he kicked you off on his class,-1
very responsible teacher,1
she is an outstanding professor evidenced by wielding and fulfilling her duties as a mentor however there are times when there are tons of tasks affixed within just a week given that it is not merely the solitary course we students cater,1
as of my two years studying in college you are the best person ive encountered you know how much its frustrating to students that we are learning at this time of pandemic thats why you make our time hassle free and pays every hard work rightfullytys,1
the most positive teacher in college goes to you sir thank you for being a model to us that good posture gives a good health pe before was never easy until i met a teacher like that ask students regarding the time so that it will be fair for everyone,1
sir bojos is an exceptional mentor he knows what he is doing exhibiting mastery in his profession he is also strict yet considerate to his students,1
sir jongko is excellent in his profession apart from that he appears not to release a bundle of tasks which diminishes students stress and load from the additional courses they possess,1
i sometimes do not understand the way he discuss the topics to us,0
she sometimes does not know what she was discussing all about so she only ask us her students to answer she presents a powerpoint and lets us students explain and give example to it which is difficult for us since we didnt know what it is all about,-1

very professional and at the same time very jamming one of the best teachers,1
the teacher shows mastery of her subject she conducts activities that allow me to apply my critical and analytical abilities she organizes her teaching aids well both during virtual classes and those posted in the lms she is very effective,1
never meets the class virtually always giving video lectures on youtube focuses more on compliance rather than learning only gave comments during the making of the grades resulting to low scores in all previously submitted works,1
rarely does virtual meetings and when he doeshe is only reading his ppt does not value confidentiality he presents our grades to everyone in the class rarely gives activities,-1

very strict in class rules but also very effective in teaching he knows the subject very well,1
he relates the lessons to real life situations that he experienced himself very considerate and inspiring,1
dr ily abella is very helpful and supportive to all of his students,1
he is rarely attending classes always giving recorded discussions or lessons that are found at youtube without him explaining it clearly to us after watching the recorded lecture he gives us activities or exercises that are difficult to comprehend,1
kudos for being very considerate the lessons are clearly explained and i also love the subject because of how maam tabat teaches she motivates her students and makes my heart melt because there are only few teachers that are like her 3,1
very inconsiderate we all know that not all students has a good internet connection but he will get annoyed whenever someone says that herhis connection is weak he also dont give the correct answer if we have a quiz on lms,-1
kung mag klase si maam kay manobra na ang oras makuhaan na ang oras para sa uban subject d pajud mogamit og ppt kung mag discuss mohatag og mga buhatonon bisag dilil iyahang schedule sa klase nya toxic gamay og mindset about sa generation z,0
shes always strict to us and gave a difficult activities,-1
everytime we ask him the discussion he will get mad at us even though we just ask him about the discussion for the last 2 or 3 months he rarely attend to his class and also he rarely gave us some activities,-1

sir ryan is an example of close to perfecrion teacher he puts very much dedication into his career to help us understand what really is the subject all about,1
miss arciete is an exceptional teacher she puts her heart in teaching us to become who we want to be she exerts a lot of effort in providing us the things that needs to be understood,-1
mr ryan should be an example for all the teachers he has really a good way of making his students learn even if its an online class maybe you could give an extra time in your exams since the questions are lengthy and needs to be processed in mind,1
in totallity miss gema is just simply portaying would look like but manifesting and emphasizing who she should be was not there,1
she just sends audio lectures without minding the disadvantages the lack of gb sa cp kay need pa i download nya maka tamad kay lahi rajud basta live discussionpero wa sya ga synchronous sadly after bombarded dayon mig lots of quizzes activities,-1
mura rag face to face iya pag handle og classes godbless sir,0
she uses relatable scenarious in a form of an example to help us understand and i think that is a character of good teacher,1
very considerate,1
maam myra is an excellent teacher coz she always observe the students of her class hour,1

miss grace is one of ucs undoubtedly a good teacher in terms of transpiring and imparting knowledge to the students her lessons resonates to all of the students in the class and that i think is an exceptional character she possesses attitude matters,1
hi sir please ayaw lang palabi ka sarcastic when it comes to students asking you something like favor or question para pud maka avoid og misunderstanding kay as a student we should be respected also,1
best physical education teacher so far,1
ako comments ane nga subjects is dili siya kama o na malo oy sa osa ka tao og na ay ehangyo nga concern sa osa ka sa students,0
maybe ms cuevas should be more understanding next time and hear out the reasons of your students,0
my favorite part is the prelim jd miss wherein ang discussion is during class jd but later on idk what happen i would also like to ask favor wherein entertain private messages from your student para maka cope up sa imong angay nga ipabuhat,1
we understand you sir,0
no asynchronous session sobraan ka strict and doesnt response in any of my messages,-1

,0
i really like her as teacher i have no comment aside from im thankful that she is my teacher on this subject i hope she will stay longer in uc and meet her someday in face to face setting but i guess i will just meet her someday outside uc,1
ms villasan is very soft spken type of person when talking to her students when no one is confident in answering she makes sure that it is okay she also doesnt give me headaches compared to other teachers who gives a lot of activities,1
thank you for being a stress reliever subject sir i hope well meet someday and continue being an approachable and chill teacher,1
this type of teacher is what every school should have thats all i can say thankyou,0
i can say that sir medardo is a history enthusiast because he really knows how to relay his knowledge to his students,1
good teacher and humble and good attitude,1
i hope she will consider students requests especially exams and i hope she will read students chats in group chat thank you miss,1
sir tebio is very nice hes a chill type of teacher and makes sure that everyone gets what he is presenting or discussing he is also a very religious man,1
hes really into mathematics because he is confident in teaching the lessons to us his students though sometimes he skips some parts of the discussion just because he knows that it was already taught during jhs days and thats insensitive act for some,1
sir gimarangan has a long patience he is very knowledgeable about his subject and he relates everything to the surroundings he is very nice and also very soft spoken he is the type of person you can ask questions because he is approachable,1
i hope he will be more considerate and listen calmly to students ideas because sometimes even if we want to ask something he will react negatively which leads us hanging or confuse and even scared to talk we also cant understand some of his discussion,1
si altubar is the best of the best no other words can describe how of a nice teacher he is you can see that he loves his job and you can also be entertained by his discussions,1
quiet serious but good in terms of discussion,1
i like him as a teacher and i hope i will be his student again next semester thank you sir,1
sir alo is very strict and strict he does his job very well but he is very strict we are afraid to ask questions because he will ask us after he answers us,1
hes insensitive doesnt discuss everything he just give video links to watch then hell ask questions during the synchronous meetings then conducts quiz the next schedule i have learned more from my classmate and what i have watched than from him,-1
miss pagobo is also strict in terms of discussion and oral recitation she is good in teaching because she delivers the topic very well and relates to real life situations she is also very strict in terms of quizzes and excuses of students,1
he is a great teacher approachable and gives other ways for us to attend his classes if we have a hard time due to internet interruptions,1
thank you for being my professor this semester,1
he is so jolly his personality breaks the boredom of the class,1
expectation vs reality it is,0
she doesnt show us our scores in the major exams and she just always sends us outputs for the reporting of each student but she always gives follow up reports,0
she is a kind of teacher have golden hearth and i learn a lot from her,0
mr dapal handles everything and you really learn something from him so thank you sir 3,1
i used to like the way this teacher discusses i always get excited when he is handling one of my subjects but hes changed he didnt discuss more often instead hes just giving us links to watch and listen to and then activities and quizzes after that,1
i would like to express my deepest appreciation to our teacher thank you for imparting good knowledge of our subject to us,1
good in motivating students teaching very professional and always give time to the students to do the task,1
id want to offer my heartfelt gratitude to our teacher thank you for imparting good knowledge of our subject to us,1
what i like about this professor is he always start our class with prayer and end with motivating quotes,1
exploitative and traumatic,-1
this teacher should be more patient especially in online classes because not all of his students have the same steady internet connection,0
good day i just want to express my own opinion about your giving of the activities for me it is alright but it is much better if its not all at once like if you have 34 subjects to teach it is much better if activities are not given at the same time,1
the type of teacher everybody deserves online learning has been very tough for both students and teachers but mr olorfernes went extra mile he gives ample time for students during exams tasks and quizzes coz he understands not every1 stable connection,-1
continue being an inspiration to others sir god bless you,1
keep it up maam,0
i like the way how sir pacaldo disscusses and handles his students well i also find him strict but in a good way i know he is strict its because he just want to help his students and he is doing it not for himself but for the good of his students,1
he should have more patience because his students kay dili steady ang internet connection,0

shes understanding towards students and shows empathy,0
shes understanding towards her students and always letting us know in advance about her projects,0
shes my favorite teacher she let us talk in class and asks about our point of views shes the only teacher that makes me not afraid to participate,1
shes my favorite teacher i love her enthusiasm in class and when we participate she makes us feel that our views are valid and she allows us have a safe space where we can practice to let our thoughts out in the open,1
one of the best teacher in terms of discussing strict but you will learn more on her subject,1
if ever you would give audio please send it ahead of time because its lengthy and we need time to listen to it because some of us are not regular students and please do hear out the concerns of those students even if you barely knew them,1
strict and he wants you to learn on your own,0
one of the best teachers he does everything possible to make the student learn he knows very well what is being taught he do some oral recitation to check if we really learn,1
i thought he was strict but when he taught us he was very good at teaching he was calm but he teaches well keeps on motivating students and always do prayer before class,1
she sometimes doesnt give clear instructions and really hard to interact with because of her attitude,-1
hoping all teachers would be like her she truly cares for his students and gives the best support she could ever give i hope uc would hire teachers like her,1
be more interactive with his students,0
she listen very well to her students opinion or comments about something amd she always asking her students why they are late submitting their outputs to understand the situation,1
he never really teach us all he does is nothing and give us buch of activities without giving us any instruction and we he only meets us maybe 4 times and last for next meeting and the worst just because he dont teach us we dont even know what to answer,-1
as a students of him i must say he is a very kind and has a very interesting discussions has a patience in discussing a certain topic,1
to be honest i dont like how he teaches us because instead he will make it eassier and make us understand he himself cant really understand what he was teaching but instead he show us that he is also confused so us students will get confused too,-1
i am satisfied with how my instructor teach during online meetings and also i have learned so many things in this course,1
thank you for sharing your thoughts through teaching us more of your discussions and topics in your subject 3,1
i love how miss olaso teaches us shes really confident to what she was saying or teaching us very detailed and so calm when shes speaking she was approachable and even makes us laugh when she feels that we are nervous,1

good afternoon sir mr altubar really did well in teaching us the complicated topic abnormal psych he makes the lesson easy for us delivering the lesson in an easy to understanding manner,1

we see subject matter knowledge as knowledge in the discipline taught by a teacher it often includes an understanding about how the discipline advances along with what is known within the discipline,0
the teacher must put her discussions in a short and brief power point presentation so that the student will have specific and very understanding towards every discussions,0
teachers require so many positive qualities like care compassion patience and commitment you have all these qualities in abundance,1
first teacher quality is positively linked with student learning this is the primary reason to develop implement and continue our efforts to improve teacher and teacher heshe want to the student improve there skill,1
the teacher should provide enough attempt when it comes in giving quizzes and even exams in order for the students to have enough attempt since not everytime cignals are in stable phones matter and many more that can affect when taking quizzes and exams,1

my comment about the teacher is that she does not attend to her class on like she is always 40 min 1 hr late to our class and i dont know how she gave us grades because she never showed it she is impatient when it comes to presentation,1
i am not into complaining my grades however the way she instruct us i was never been satisfied i know how be grateful but i just hope that it was worth it because i see in her the dedication to help us more educated,1
sometimes its really hard to communicate with her the way she gave us quizes gamay ra kaayo ang time we all know na ang connection sa student naa gyuy times na dili stable so mo lag gyd sya we hope mausab sya but she still a good teacher in teaching,1

i love how mam borja discussing these whole topic and of course she delivered it well,1
this subject which ive learned a lot coz it really helps me to add with my own knowledge to think own,1
ive learned a lot of this especially by enhancing on my own critical thinking,-1
he only attended our class during the first day in which he discussed about some topics after his birthday he didnt attend our classes anymore he didnt even gave our midterm grades yet he wont also respond in our gc,0
for me my opinion of my teacher in aid is she is kind and she accepts reason from his students and when she teaches she is only right to teach that his students learn or understand quickly,1
this subject really requires facetoface interaction he cant just expect us to do the stances perfectly even if he already provided us videos seeing the stances and the like personally is more efficient than watching videos teaching us how to do it,1
she often gives us activities we arent familiar with wont give enough instructions regarding how to do it when she grades our output shed give a low score just because we havent followed what she said was in her instructions doesnt exist,-1
she is a kind teacher because she listens to the side when her students receive her openion thier class and she is kind she is also hardworking and she goes along with her students and most of all when she teaches she will ask us question if we understand,1
when he teaches us it is easier for us to understand what he is saying because he explains well and he accompanies his students sir is kind and accepts ipenion and rwason from his students and we have no problem with sir,1
next time when you give considerations to other students to take the missed quiz change or shuffle the questions if possible,-1
he is always out of reach especially in times when we need guidance and clarifications from his online activities we only had three or four virtual meetings throughout this semester,0
i like how she always ask us about our day and if we are okay or not she handles us so well,1
she is a kind teacher she has a good heart because she helps her students to increase their knowledge in what she teaches and maam so that she will know more that we have increased our knowledge we are the ones who are encouraged to explain and answer,1
for si miss faith ay mabuting guro pinapakinggan niya ang side nang tudents niya and pag nag tuturo siya ay mahinahon lang at mag tatanong siya kung naiintindihan ba namin ang tinuturo niya kasi pag hindi ay inuulit niya ito para mas maintindihan namin,-1
si sir he is a kind person dahil sumasabay siya sa mga students niya and besides of that tumatanggap siya nang openion and reason ng students niya at pag nag tuturo siya ay kalmado lang at mag tatanong siya kung naiintindihan ba namin kasi uulitin niya,1

sir loyd is the best teacher i could ever ask for very good in all aspects he should be the standard,1
she made the students report the entire semester would have been better if she taught us something,1
simply one of the best teachers his discussions are on point very intelligent and is very good at making his students understand the lessons sir altubar is one of the reasons why i still enjoy my college life,1
hes always angry when students were just asking him for clarifications could have used a better approach rather than getting angry every time,-1
she is an excellent teacher and very considerate to the students especially those who are working students i also love the way she teaches us and she makes sure that her student understands the topic,1
he did a lot of things in the discussion where we can understand him in the simplest way possible i hope a lot of teacher are more like him,1
one of the best teacher for me,1
hes a good teacher and we can see that he really has the mastery in his subject field however at some times he is not that considerate to my other classmates and doesnt have a broad understanding about their situation even though the reason is valid,1
thank you so much for a progressive online class in pe miss,1
very bad at handling her class conducts online class even if its not her time gives a huge amount of unnecessary activities which make the students exhausted her standard is so high and unrealistic super inconsiderate she does more harm than good,-1

very considerate and understanding a teacher that every student can be proud of,1
it means a lot knowing there are teacher like you sir who understands students well,1
my experience with sir pacaldo is that he delivers the lesson well the only thing i find it boring the crowd seems like no energize because our subject is literature but on the other hand he attend the class regularly,1
super considerate communicates to students effectively her notes are super useful truly cares about her students you can feel her passing when she discusses the lessons overall shes a great teacher wish more teachers will aspire to become like her,1
great teacher and handles students fantastically,1
to avoid confusion for the next students that you will handle if you do not want them answer or do the activity yet in lms please do not put it there instead just hide it and open it after you explain the activity pls respond to concerns nicely ty,1
my experience with maam pagobo is that the way she discuss is good all of us amaze the way she deliver the topic but one thing i find it hard on her subject there are a lot of activities to be submitted the pressure is real i suggest that take it easy,1
she doesnt teach effectively majority of the class notice that she shows favoritism bad in articulating useful ideas her way of handling her class is kind of a mess shes a bad teacher,-1
she is also a good teacher i can see her mastery in her subject field but then often times he only sends an audio recording for the discussion and knowing that some of the students are visual learners she is still an excellent teacher,1
he has the mastery of the subject a perfectionist teacher however we learn from it,1
an excellent teacher he is a very kind and considerate teacher he is considered for me as one of the best teachers,1
i suggest that please take it easy when you are going to give a particular topic or task to do the pressure is real when you give us a lot then the dealine for the submission i hope you consider,1
her standards are unrealistically high her grading system is the worst all my scores are way higher than my classmates yet she gave me 25 but my classmate whos all scores are lower than mine is 15 emily is the worst she should quit,-1

very approachable mentor and she gives confidence to students to answer,1
she should enhance her connectivity because she always makes an excuse for it and she needs to try other online platform for her activities since she is the only person who dont use the lms for assignments and examinations,1
sometimes posted activities which is not our scheduled time not everyone can answer it directly and give deadline also within not our class schedule,0
very engaging teacher and can really help students to motivate in our learnings,1
she should always keep on mind the class hours because she starts late and then we only have few more minutes to cater the topics so more often she extends her class time which would conflict other classes because her discussion is still going on,-1
she should continue to handle well her classes as students are actively participating on her classes,1

he is knowledgeable but being boastful in tone of speaking which make the ambience of the class quite weird,-1

she is the best teacher however due to her internet connection issues we cannot talk about our topic continuously,1
his discussion was very good like it will make you remember clearly and also hes a jamming professor he always do discussion lively which will make you not bored upon listening and makes interests to learners many experiencd and knowledge to share,1
engaging history teacher but one he told us we are exempted from the finals exam if we buy a book only from a certain store and we should put his name on it idk if it is allowed some did it anyway bc its his requirement,1
thank you for sharing your experiences and the knowledge you have that we can acquired in the future,1
thank you for the learnings godbless always,1
he is a good teacher his style is effective as i learned so much from him even if he doesnt meet us virtually sometimes,1
sir magno is very strict he always tell us to ask question in the class but when we ask he will just laugh insultingly and answer our question very deeply that we cant understand he dont listen to his student opinion,1
shes very nice and always listen to the opinion of her students,1
thank you for sharing your learning and experiences godbless,1
his teaching style is effective however for the whole prelim and midterm period i only saw him thrice he updates on our gc though,1
thank you for sharing your learnings to us godbless,1
hes a wonderful teacher he always listen to his students opinion and always give us a chance if we fail to answer an exam or a quiz,1
hes nice,1
my ideal teacher he is firm and presents formality in class his behavior is what makes students study harder and do their tasks more effictively,1
he does have mood swings sometimes he is super cool and calm at the next meeting he is furious hehe we do not know why although he is a great teacher making us realize the power of reading,1
amazing,1
so far doc borja is so good it is sad that shell be retiring,1
continue to be a good teacher to us sir,1
please continue to be a good teacher to us,1
handling is not so organized almost always forget to give proper instructions to the given assignment,-1
pwede naay synchronous ug asynchronous panagsa rakay mag discussion thru gmeet kasagaran recorded discussion ra,0
teaching is good however sometimes puts too much pressure to student that lessens the motivation,1
our scores are above average but she gave low grades to her students classes are done mostly through reporting and some quiz questions are not from the discussion,-1
keeps reminders handson teacher he sends personal messages to check on his student he always makes sure you have a takeaway after each class best teacher strict in the right way,1
miss trina is a good teacher and she will entertain the concerns of every students,1
she rarely give reviews on the correct answers on our quizzes and for that we ended up repeating incorrect answers yes we do research and even study but still its really different if the teacher herself could provide the right answers,1
he only meet us once that was on the first day of class but he would leave some notes for us to study and activities for us to do during his time,-1
he never entertain the concerns of every student through to the some strategies that he used it is hard for the part of every student thats why we have some concerns but he never entertain of it,-1
she is inactive when it comes to student inquiries seldom answers researchrelated queries and even when students perform well she does not provide credit or good grades which he or she deserves no matter what the students complies she does not give,1
he rarely attends the class he makes an announcement without any prior notice,0
she assigns difficult work on occasion and she assigns a poor mark even when the student meets all of the requirements,-1
im perplexed by how she scores us because i complete the prescribed activity but receive a low mark hopefully she can adjust that technique or inform her students about how she calculates grades all in all shes a great teacher,1
she lets her students do the reporting and selects them at random when they are completely uninformed on the topic same issue with how she scores her students when she is only occasionally there and still gives them low grades,-1
he is a good teacher for me i can really understand all of the discussion because he wont stop explaining until everybody get it he is the teacher ive ever know,1
she deserves a raise one of the top cte teachers hopefully she will continue to teach at cte and inspire people like me to pursue careers in the field of literature,1
she has no consideration strict and not even approachable and cannot see our effort,-1
shes a good teacher,1
less discussion but too much school works given inconsiderate the teacher is unconcerned about the students feelings,-1
maam ares is such an inspiration to her students approachable and considerate she has a good heart for her students,1
very good teacher very jamming and comfortable to be with,1
outstanding teacher,1
we heard nothing from him until we had to raise a complaint in our department he does not know how to teach accounting is a hard subject to understand yet he does not teach us and instead lets us watch a youtube video that is not even his,-1
very smart,1
best comp teacher,1
she always makes the discussion interesting even the tone of her voice makes us wanna learn more even its 730 in the morning,1
he is very careless in encoding our scores thats why some of us complaining about the grades because he gave low grades,-1
very energetic kind and understanding teacher makes math easier,1
strict precise but very smart teacher,1
less discussion and very inconsiderate the teacher is unconcerned about the students feelings and situation,-1
the tone of his voice is not clearly heard because its not that loud and clear thats why i can say that his discussion is a bit boring also he didnt turn on his camera during the discussion,-1
he is not that type of teacher who is very considerate towards the opinions of the student he always says that you need to be like this and like this also he keep on relating his discussion to politics and that made me bothered,1
shes a good teacher to us,1
he is the good teacher for me,1
she is the good teacher for me,1
okey rmn sya nindot sya motudlo makasabot ra dayun ko pero ang problema kay sa pag pass sa mga activities dugay kaau na save nmo kay miss nahumn nlang ang midterm kay di daw sya maka connect sa iyahang lms,1

sir melgar is one of the best teacher,1
he doesnt reply to students messages and is not clear in giving instructions,-1
he never lessen to the students concern he even called us mga bobo,0
hope sunod mag discuss sa siya before maghatag ig exercises or mga answeranan kay makahilak jud siya i understamd na nahan ra siya mangita mig native ways para masabtan namo ang topic but not all individuals are like him na smart kaayo,1

a kind of teacher that will always based your grades on records,0
what you give records to her is only what grades that you will get,0
bes in subject mastery kind of teacher,0
to be honest this teacher doesnt show his professionalism instead na mag motivate siya ng students and i correct yung mga mistakes namin he always insulted our works and sometimes i heard some foul and vulgar words like bobo,1
he should learn to have patience since he doesnt have that,0
this teacher was a excellent performance for me,1
one of the best teachers that ive ever met,1
he is the best educator that ive encountered so far i learned a lot from him especially on the major subjects and i want uc to invest teachers just like mr melgar,1
he didnt give a consideration nor listening the explaination of the students,0
our instructor to this subject is too strict to the point that we ll afraid to join in gmeet because we feel that we need to be perfect before joining,1
during the first month of class you didnt attend then ga libog nami kung naa paba or wla,0
mas nindot sd ipa lingaw2 ug engage since uban gipang duka kay na bored,1
sir pls lang ko sunod kung discuss gani ka mas butangi pud og ka buhay2 kay pwerti jud guslaa sa imong discussion mura ratag naka atubang og highscool students na nag report,-1
he seldom conducts synchronous meetings lessons are only instilled through a youtube video and it is not elaborated on nor explicitly explained inappropriate teaching approaches and i think this must be taken into account,0

i dont like how she handles lates and absent when it comes to my grades she didnt record my output because i was mark absent due to connections and it only happen once but she already give me 21 when in fact i have perfect quizzes,1
amazing and most fave teacher because he handles us well,1
very jolly amazing and very amazing teacher ever,1

very empathetic and respectable teacher,1

miss limbaga is a teacher that very confident from what she learn through this subject and she is able to share it with us i love the that she discuss all her learnings from this subject every topic she gave us activities after the discussion,1
i like attending his class because its not boring at all his activities are not heavy and dont take too much time to perform sir bong really made me like pe because of how he handles his class and the subject,1
she doesnt give too many activities and is very approachable she answers the students questions immediately,0
sir ababon always makes sure to remind his students about the projects activities quizzes and exams he also gives extensions on due dates,1
maka nervous si sir pero okay raahahahahamaldito lng gud kaayo,-1

ms ybanez is an effective teacher she ensures that her students will learn effectively after each lesson,1

mr lumontad is a productive educator he puts effort in every discussion and he explores methods and strategies that would help us understand the lesson efficiently,1
mr dizon is a fun and engaging instructor there was never a dull moment in his class,1
mr alcantara is a competent educator he shows mastery in every lesson,1
mr illut is an effective communicator he relates the lesson to real life situations,1

mr dechos is great educator who motivates his students to enjoy learning he proves that learning is fun he is both a great educator and role model,1
thank you for being considerate sir,1
i hope nga mo consider sad ka sa imuha mga students sir nga unstable and internet connection usahay kay og unstable sd imuha network sir mo sabot rman sad mi thank you,-1
the sad thing here is that he will not show us the wrong and right response after the quiz in that case we cant correct our mistakes and we cant learn from it,-1
i am very amaze of you sir youre very approachable and fun to be with thank you for sharing your knowledge and your thoughts with us,1

hgfdyfchgv,0
thanks maam hope to see u again,1
,0
thankyou sir dexter lodi ng bayan we are all grateful that you are our instructor stay healthy and i hope dilika mag usab mwuah,1
next time maam please accept our excuses when times we cannot join the class due to slow internet connection and blackout give us a special task if happen,1
the first time that she entered the class all was good but after the prelim exams she was not consistent in synchronous sessions anymore causing almost of my classmates to have low grades in her subject,-1
di kabaw maminaw namo di kabaw mo sabot di kabaw mo angkon sa sayop di halos magpa kita sige rag hatag recorded nya quiz ug activity dayon bisag wa mi kasabot ug tarong sa iyang recorded na discussions syempre di man mi ka panguta for clarifications,0
since its understandable that its still online class in the prelim and midterm he did not execute along with his students but regardless of it he motivates us and corrects us in a calm manner,1
di kabaw minaw namo siya permi sakto kusog pa kaayo mang insulto,0
mo meet rag ganahan,0
a bit pressured because he seldom holds asynchronous session and right after his discussion he recapitulates and conducts quizzes right away its manageable considering were college students but he could have given other activities aside from quizzes,-1
he must provide engaging interaction because i noticed that some of my classmates are not paying attention to the reporters considering that were still practicing our skills in speaking regardless of that i admire him for being considerate,1
she attends her classes late due to our schedule of 1230 but still manages to finish the things that need to be done i can see that shes competent but when it comes to concerns we cannot communicate easily because there is no group chat designated,-1
so far so good this is one of the teachers that get along with some of my classmates and has this millennial spirit but still professional enough to handle classes,1
i think it would be better that we can freely speak our topic in reporting and be corrected afterwards given that this is a major subject then it requires assessment and clarification but in a way that most of us cannot feel shame but enlightenment,1
to be honest math doesnt engage me specially that its scheduled on 730am so i think it would be better if a refresher could be done before classes starts to ensure that the students are attentive regardless of it i admire him for being competent,1
during the first sessions of classes we were asked if someone could volunteer on agility exercises in that way my confidence was boosted i can see that hes someone that pushes and practices his students to take responsibility to us rotc cadets,1
during the prelim and midterm exams some of the questions were not based on the book he should have provided us with the notes for us to study because he might have referred to other references we werent aware of but overall he taught us well,1
prelims and midterms are done from cisco website and he only went synchronous class from the very beginning of the 2nd sem now semifinals he sometimes do some discussion synchronous but still provide yt links for class discussion,0
not satisfied,-1
accommodating,0
strict,0
none at all,0
he just provide material to be study for the upcoming quiz but sometimes the questions are not really related to his given reviewer also this subject cost a lot but we received inadequate knowledge,-1
prelim midterm exams and quizzes are done from cisco website while now semifinals he rarely do some discussion instead he provided yt links for the synchronous session which is inappropriate for me,0
miss ybaez is a kind and efficient teacher she is probably one of my favorite teachers this semester she makes sure that we all understand her lessons and frequently answers are queries regarding the topics discussed,1
she is one of the kindest teachers in uc very considerate and enthusiastic,1
i would say that shes not really a responsible teacher,-1
not a responsible teacher,-1
such a good and compassionate teacher,1
shes very excellent in teaching however she always overload us with so much activities,1
she is a very good teacher,1
inconsiderate sometimes,-1
the subject is easy to understand but she sometimes complicate things thats hard for us to understand,1
inconsiderate and doesnt give students time to respond knowing online class is laggy for most students,-1
the subject is supposed to be easy but the way she handled the class makes the subject english hard,1
idk just felt like giving a 5,1
doesnt give clear instruction to the activities and missed few classes but got mad at us for not understand the topic the she should have been discussing at that time period,-1
poor time management skills poor public speaking skills,-1
she often gives unclear instructions in activities that is given,-1
always give students hard time and he is always mad he kicked multiple students during the meet because they cant answer the question and always have a tantrum many students are already afraid to join his classes,-1
he often gets mad at us if we got the wrong answer even if we got the correct answer hes still mad because were too slow in giving the answer to his questions how can we easily understand the lesson when we barely know the topic we are not that smart,-1
this teacher made my life a living hell,-1
our instructor is good to teach and also teaching clear always,1
the teacher is ok and i only learned 50 of his teaching,1
his good teachers student learning and professional contributions and the way teach is not bad is good and his want the students to learn and always remember the activitys and last period always announce,1
all perfect because his teaching is good and he doesnt struggle the students and also is not a boring teacher he also gives good grades,1
sometimes our instructor is i cant understands their give instructor but instructor is not problem the way teach is ok,1
i dont understand because its always 5 point or 100 points i think my grade is not that good and also sometime if we have to ask a questioned in gc she doesnt respond but the way her teach is ok,1
the teacher nstp is not problem the teach but only one is exam she give 30 mins thats it but over all is good,1
sometimes is activate give the activity and quiz but he only joins zoom class sometimes but gives activates quizzes exams and his teaching are slow,0
this teacher is good and also the way give grade is nice and also the activities and also is not boring,1
shows mastery of the subject matter and also respect the student and also the good teach and effort not really boring,1
outstanding professor,1
very intelligent teacher,1
very kind teacher,1
i cant say anything but words thank you,1
strict si miss pero always on time asa class then mo accept ra sa opionions and suggestions,1
cute mo discuss si miss bisag lisod hahaa,1
nice kaayu si miss hinay lang jud connection usahay,1
he can finish a chapter discussion without even making it a fastpaced discussion it doesnt feel like hes just reading the material hence he really does discuss it very well for us to be able to understand the topic,1
grabi ka strikto si sir pero ganahan rako niya sa iyang teaching wayss,0
nice rajud si sir mo quiz and activities,1
late usahay pero nice mo lecture,1
hes so far the best teacher in this online class setup hes wellmannered and does whats need to be done he also reminds us about our meets and activities so that we dont miss any of it,1
im sad to say this but mr larona is not an efficient teacher for me i find it hard to answer his quizzes and exams because most of it arent part of his discussion nor on the ppt slides he provided i am having a hard time to learn on his class,-1
we hope that she well handle class nice and she will be approachable in all way she will further discussion and give feedback to students output like she needs to give the correct one we need to know our scores thank you,1
a typical normal instructor professional at her works hardworking kind thoughtful instructor,1
he is a professional and hardworking instructor he is kind considerate approachable and do his best to communicate with us understands other empathetic,1
professional and hardworking teacher very thoughtful and relatable so kind and very understanding person,1
professional and hardworking to her works strict and because of that she is hard to approach and the students are scared to answer to her questions so responsible and focus on doing her work,-1
kind nice professional hardworking friendly relatable teacher his subject is fun and very interesting the way he handles students are very fair,1
professional hardworking teacher i like his style that is just cool with his discussions and its understandable hes thoughtful kind and i think he likes rizal very much,1
professional and very hardworking that she handles so many works and even her schedule is full of work very understanding teacher kind nice very responsible teacher,1
professional and hardworking to his work kind and hes like a scientist i dont know why i still dont know what kind of teacher he is but he is just like the other or most teacher that im under in like just doing his job,1
i really appreciate the effort mr sagulili has been exerting for the class he always updates us on our facebook group chat thank you so much sir,1
very bless to have such a great professor may god bless him always,1
a very talented teacher hoping to be like him in the near future in front of my students,1
i love his energy hoping to bring this energy in front of my future students,1
it would be better if you will conduct activities that are aligned to the courseapplied motor control and learningiam not motivated to enter the class coz im done sa all topics from our bped4 activities mustbe more on performances,1
activities and performances that you will require must be engaging and align to our course,1
the topics discussed by the teacher are not relevant to the subject matter she is teaching us about conversion and operations of the number system which is not in line with our subject which is comp 100 computer application,1
he does not have an attendance in the lms and he rarely discussed a lesson when he discussed he does not present any file or powerpoint presentation on the screen,0
he doesnt have put class attendance in the lms and he rarely discussed a lesson when he discussed it he doesnt present any files or powerpoint presentations on the screen,0
she never conducts virtual discussion just video discussion only which is difficult on our part since after that she gives us the assignment seatwork and quiz the after the quiz she reviews everything next chapter it really affects our grades,-1
not active nor attentive during meetings she would tell us to message her if we had questions regarding the activity but when doing so she fails to respond to messages a fellow student messaged her more than a week ago but she still hasnt responded,-1
she is good and approachable easy to raise concerns she definitely understands students concerns and she treats us like her own children she is nice and gives us the motivation to keep striving and be motivation on oneself,1
this teacher is very inactive and was only able to teach us late into the semester after a concerned student brought this issue up to maam pagobo his teaching style has much to be desired,1
she is good and approachable easy to raise concerns she definitely understands students concerns and she treats us like her own children she is nice and gives us the motivation to keep striving and be motivated by ourselves,1
she may be strict if we are absent in our synch sessions we are not allowed to take the quiz or join the activity which is not fair we students have difficulty with internet connections and she doesnt consider it absent no output,-1
very professional and approachable well done,1
very professional and approachable well done,1
he completely apply his unique techniques in teaching and very professional,0
she always do some quiz and assignment and she did not discuss the topic thats why we are having a hard time on our subject and our prof dli mo consider,-1
to elaborate and explain more about the activities and make sure the students understood the task,1
during quizzes kay dapat the whole hour will be used not just by minutes lang pd,0
to make the quizzes and exams shorter kay itll take time for us to solve and evaluate our answers and the quizzes kay usually up to 100 then the time is very limited ra maka pressure sad sya because of the time,-1
sir i must say that you are far too strict the teachers purpose is to simplify the lesson but i believe you make it too difficult in my opinion i understand that it is a challenge for us as students but it is too difficult for us,-1
during prelim to midterm i actually dont like how ms eve handled us she is strict and unapproachable every synchronous sessions she always did oral reading quizzes and exams but during final she change into a good and approachable teacher,1
she doesnt attend his class regularly but i understand her because she is also a public school teacher,0
there are times that your questions in the quiz or seatwork that we did not discuss and in addition there are no given answers on the checking of the quiz or seatwork continue to teach because we gain something and learn,1
he did not meet out of the class since day 1 they just give a lesson in pdf then after they exam lot of difficulties,-1
super approachable,1
in prelim and midterm only 2 out 26 passed in our section,0
very good instructor,1
he maintain the discipline in the school and very professional,0
he prefers to conduct his lessons via prerecorded discussions that he posts on youtube i think it would be fair if he keep his videos straightforward rather than lengthy his political views are sometimes included in his lecture,1
she always make students bombarded and always leave a trauma or fears to my colleagues,-1
hope miss di ka sig pa oral kay di lalim,1
unta miss di naka sig hatag activities nya ang ending gamay kaayo mig grades gihapon bisag complete mis tanan,-1
unta miss di naka favoritism nga pagka teacher nya if naa kay concern sa students imo untang tarongon ug istorya dili kay imong kasab an diritsyo and hope sad mo angkon sad kas imo g sayop di kay ipa feel nimo nga tumoy ramis ballpen permi,-1
hope sir di naka sige kasuko namo sige kag hatag quizes namo nya di kaayo ka mag discuss sige rami nimog pa tan awn ug videos nga naa sa lms nya ug wa mi matubag masuko ka namo self study yarn,1
well i admit that i am not good enough in writing strokes but i am able to recite the oral she gave but still she gave us failing grades i really dont like the way she handle our class we are just a begginer i hope she will understand it,-1
straight 5 for this instructor eventhough mag reporting rami she still share her knowledge to add to the discussion also her activity kay makakat on jud ko,1
ok ra si sir however naay times na mo sulod siya sa 9 am na class instead na kami na 730 then later on mga around 830 or basta hapit na mahuman amoang time diha pa siya mo feedback na lahi iyang na sudlan this happened more than twice,1
he is a very nice instructor that is why i am giving him straight 5 however dili niya e hatag ang result sa amoang exam ang score lang dili namo ma review asa mi na wrong para ma assess namo amoang learning but iyang materials is helpful kaayu,1
the method of teaching ni maam limbaga is not effective at all if mag discuss kay choppy dili tarung mo hatag instruction sa activity asta sa quiz dili masabtan ang instruction maong daghag gagmay og scores then ang ppt di masabtan way lain materials,-1
he is a very good teacher all our topic he discuss it well he is also very understanding teacher,1
she is very understanding teacher she gave us enough time to submit our activities she also follow ups students who are not in the meeting,0
he is a good teacher he always check herhis students those who didnt attend the class and he explain our discussion very well,1
he is not good in teaching the students all of us even in the previous students every time he handle students he gave us 36 in midterm grade that in the first place as what i have observed on his teaching profession is not so good as a teacher,-1
please ayaw na daghana number imo quizes kay lisod kaayu ang imong gipang hatag kami ray lahi na sec na topic okey raman ka mag teach pero imo quizes lng please lng,1
ms lawas doesnt give an exact instructions and information in an activity thus we always ask other students with different teacher she sometimes also change our class time because shes busy even though we also have another class on the said time,0
sakit sa akong side nga gihatagan kog unexpected grade nya ang instructor ani dili kaau mag synchronous class nag reach out ko nga mag pa check sa ako acitvity kay late siya ning sulod 81030 class pero 10 ningsulod nya conflict na sa other class nako,-1

such as a good and well mannered teacher,1

good and well mannered teacher,1

hes unfair in giving grades just those who are good at communicating with him will be given higher grades i think its unethical how about those students who are not that too smart like others in the class i hope everything will be fine and sound,1

excellent teacher kudos dr montezon,1
excellent teacher,1
one of my favorite teacher,1
sir mendoza is a very nice teacher for me his way of teaching is very effective as i can easily understand the lessons in every synchronous session he always shows us a powerpoint presentation to guide us through the discussion,1
sir solijon is an approachable and understanding teacher he responds nicely especially when we have concerns he also always presents a power point in every synchronous meeting and explains to us the topics clearly in a way we can directly understand,1
excellent at teaching i wish he will be my teacher until 4th year i wanna learn more and i want to be his close stident soon i hope he reads this,1
always very good and fluent in english very professional and caring,1

thank you so much miss kay masinabtanon kaau ka,1
doing best in class,1
she is very strict when it comes to each lesson ensuring that we are able to learn something but sometimes the discussion is way to fast quizexam times could be extended a little since it is too short for us to somehow comprehend and understand,1
a great balance of a great teacher and a cool teacher,1
ensures that we are able to understand each points she makes explains thoroughly that is a very great help for a law subject,1
also explains very well and is a good teacher,1
teaches very well and ensures that we really learn from him about his subjects,1
the teacher has slow internet connection every discussion and failure to answer his question will be our mistake,-1
this teacher rarely attends the class approximately 3 or 4 times per month it always feels like she is always in a rush when she is teaching because she reads the topic very fast and it is hard for us to fully understand the topic,1
this is a research class and it is already the semifinals but we are still in the process of accepting our research title because she rarely attends the class and sometimes its a miracle that she attends twice the class in one month,1
very nice kaayo na teacher si sir malearn jd me,1
may na pero among research tawn wapamasugdi gamay pakayo mig grados midterm,0

the teacher has slow internet connection every discussion and failure to answer his question will be the students mistake,-1
inconsiderate,-1
gives a hundred items quizexam in 1 12 hr it is ineffective for us students coz we cant read the questions choices and openended problems wcalculations well due to timepressure we cant even finish his exams and its disheartening for us student,-1
sir maawa ka namn po sa amin ayaw pud tas a ang mga quizzes ug exam sir as in sir kulang ra kau sa time ang exams sir makaguol kau sir hinaut sa finals nga quiz ug exams sir di na parehas karun grabe kataas,-1
i compiled and never missed any single activity yet she gave me a 23 which according to her is equivalent to ng i asked and she did not give me a reasonresponse i am a dl and acad scholar my other classmates have the same concerns as well,1
i dont understander her every time she gave us an activity she always adds up our activity every week and it is always in alphabetical order she just stops in the letter d last name and then she will forget the activity we always confront about it,-1
his fit for his job,1
not fluent in english he gives a grade 40 to students if they are unable to answer the oral recitation,0
panagsa ra mo sulod unya mag pa answer or quizzes nga wala gi discuss i dont like that kind of treatment of teacher,-1
akong advice lang nimo sir please po tarunga pag grado namo midterm daghan ga reklamo kay hagbong og gamay ilang grado but it turns dako diay ilang grade pero di naka ka change sa portal,-1
i dont like the strategy that he use he discuss first in every topic that he sent on lms then every tuesday is for activity while wednesday is for checking and discussion in part i always get low score,-1
he is one of the best teacher i ever had thank you so much sir,1
the ratings above will tell,0
the best and chillin prof,1
atty cheryl is very considerate of our concerns and does not hesitate to extend deadlines whenever we find the class topic difficult,1
does not follow time provided on studyload overtime 731901pm schedule goes beyond upto 10pm always ask us to extend,1
i am hoping that he listen or reply our concerns through messenger or gcs especially we are in a virtual communication,1
im just confuse of what day is our synchronous and which is not because most of the time we have synchronous class the whole week,-1
i like the way he provides a quiz or an exam to students with very much time allowance considering that not all students have stable internet but the downside is mr de vera always starts his class 30 minutes late and gives an announcement late as well,1
sir emman is such a nice teacher i have learned a lot and im willing to learn more from him,1
i like his teaching skills and very approachable he always giving us a consideration depends on the reason and giving us quotes to cheer up,1
every time that she will have a class i always have the feeling of fear and just lately i lost motivation,-1
thankyou sir hehhe,0
thankyou sir fir putting all your efforts to teach us,0
thankyou mam for putting all your effort to teach us and thankyou for being one of the most open minded teacher that i ever encounter because it really help me breath a little because a lot of projects activities and so on in every subject that i have,1
for me i would heartily suggest that maam leah will be able to deliver her discussions more confidently because in most cases during synchronous meetings i hear her cracking voice that maybe she is nervous but i truly understand her,1
i love how sir dennis handles our class and hopefully the other students who are still not under his supervision will be able to experience his greatness,1
sir allan is always open for more suggestions and opinions from students which make the class more interesting and the interaction of students and the teacher is really seen through his way of conducting classes,1
in his delivery alone he possesses mastery but the visual aid provision was never seen during his synchronous meetings except reports but the aids are provided by the students his voice is also inaudible sometimes which makes us barely understand,-1
sir is a good teaching that you will easily,1
im proud to this teacher,1
one of the best pe teacher ive had engaged thru online class,1
hello engr visda sir hinaot unta nga dako ka mo hatag og grado namo the reason why we failed sa imong mga quizzes tungod kay wa kay klaro mo instruct walay tarong nga instructionskami tanan lami kaayu eh reklamo nimo pero imo nya ming tubagon og bati,-1
hello doc we hope tarungon nimo pag grado karong finals kay sa midterm halos naka report na tanan tas perfect pa sa mga quizzes pasar pa sa exams tapos gaan rami nimog halos mura nami wala nisud sa imong klase thanks amping diha,1
gives a lot of activities without considering that there are also activities that is needed to be passed for other subjects always overtime whenever having synchronous classes,0
i always feel nervous in her class,-1
i hope he can manage the exam because its always 100 items every quiz,1
good teacher ggwp thank you,1
not an understanding professor especially to working students we just want a teacher who knows our struggles but she cant be one for her money is very easy to find because she will then gave a fnal word that my batchmate is already not passed,1
dr sagayno explains all subject matters very well and is able to simplify topics for students to comprehend easily,1
i really like miss paula because she doesnt do things difficult for us its just neutral unlike the other teachers,1
sir xavier is a good teacher but hes always giving recorded videos that exceeds his time limit like 1 hour and 30 mins or 2 hours then 23 videos then every time theres a video theres a quiz he is the only teacher who does that,1
i love miss marilyn the way the reporting goes she has a soft voice that doesnt make us embarassed if we answer her question,1
she is a good strict teacher thats very good but it makes us terrified everytime she has reporting then quiz and then the most difficult is the exam,-1
doc sagayno is a very approachable professor and was able to deliver the course on making business research clear and simplified thank you so much doc,1
despite the complexity of the course doc alcantara was able to present the topics understandably he gave us techniques to easily compute and get the answer with reallife applications,1
doc ilys approach to theory validation in relation to the course was effective as i was able to share my insights about being an industry practitioner and learned from my comasterands inputs,1
the theory validation approach upon discussion with doc ily was commendable although i am not a human resource practitioner i was able to learn concepts and validated theories that are currently applied by companies,1
she doesnt know how to handle students concerns and other important matters that are related to the subject,1
she knew how to manage her class well,1
he knew how to manage her class well,1
she is good at handling students and delivering the topic well,1
he is good at handling students and delivering the topic well,1
quizzes and exams are too long but the overall experience is very good,1
learning is so much fun with this teacher highly appreciated,1
the best thing i learned from this teacher is age is not a hindrance to also learn especially technology,1
always late in class and always exceeds the time in class when students say sir its already time he doesnt care,-1
he is very nice and good teacher,1
best teacher in all my mba subjects that i enrolled to,1
doc llamedo starts the sem by discussing everything about the subject including all the requirements and deadlines he provides the course outline material which guides the students all throughout the semester,0
i suggest that doc biore provides course outline file so that students will be guideded all throughtout the semester,0
i suggest that doc ram provides a combination of synchronous and asynchronous mode of teaching especially that he has a required output per topic or reporter,0
i suggest that doc sagayno attends the class prepared,1
this subject was particularly hard for me because of my limited experience in this area dr judy ann has been gracious and understanding and her patience kept me pressing on and i was stretched with more learnings thank you,1
dr ando prefers facetoface class management her audio level is sometimes weak and she does not hear when a student responds to her questions so it can seem like she talks over the students and we know that is not her intention thank you,-1
hes the best teacher that i can ever ask for,1
i love doc pena very professional and makes sure that we can cover all modules on time,1
i love doc abella and his teaching style very practical and relatable reallife lessons,1
he is the life of the party very funny i love his lectures and enjoy listening to him,1
we had classes even if it is easter sunday he is very professional,0
kudos to doc sagayno very funny but professional,1
as a student even though the subject is hard the professor delivers as stressfree very calm and easygoing mapa sana all ka an lang an tanan professor as graduate school ingon ani niya,1
maam is somewhat unique because she dont spoon feed the class instead every meeting we will have oral recitation for the lesson and the activity,0
very considerate teacher,1
comprehensive discussions were evidently done by the teacher,1

sir argate makes the class very interesting and very easy to understand he makes sure that we understood the content of what he discusses and we also got to learn new things from him he is a very inspirational person for us teachers,1
sir argate is an excellent teacher,1
he does not regularly attend classes he is always late his class is scheduled from 500 to 630 in the evening but he enters the class around 545 to 600 he also has never discussed any of the topics he gave he only posted video links on lms,0
the topics in the subject are already lengthy as they are but they become even more lengthy because she does not summarize them after the discussions she also uses all her meetings she has only had a few asynchronous classes,0
his subject is hard enough as it is but it becomes even harder because he only leaves the responsibility of discussing with his students who are not knowledgeable in the subject he does not elaborate on the topics reported by students,-1

his an amazing and great teacher of all time,1

thank you doc pena for imparting your knowledge,1
i like how doc penas style of asking questions to prepare us for the oral revalida,1
i like how doc biore relates the topic to the current trends and happenings of our current time,1
mastery of the subject matter is present he also applies the theories to reallife experiences,0
reinforcement of the subject matter with real work situations examples are important thank you,1
theres a need to reinforce the reports by the student reporters if virtual teaching continues interactive class is very important and the teachers reinforcement of subject matter is needed to ensure students have understood the reports,1
this professor ensures that all his students have understood the topic his subject matter reinforcement has always been there during our class,0
thank you,1
she doesnt allow us to review our quizzes and in result we arent aware of our mistakes,-1
be more considerate,1
hes very strict especially his rules but i love how strict he is because it has a positive outcome he is not strict for nothing using multiplebased learning he shows mastery of the subject and more encouraging to students,1
lack of mastery of the subject,-1
sometimes hes unreachable,0
very approachable hes giving students a no pressure and stress online learning,-1
maam suello is very professional and passionate with her being an accounting teacher although i found the subject difficult but still there is no doubt that the problem is not her or her teaching ways very approachable and kind teacher,-1
honestly speaking this instructor does not teach the students in fact the last time she attend online class was on the month of february and after that we didnt have sychronous classes already she just kept posting activities without even discussing,1
in my own opinion the topics discussed are fine but i think the modules she is providing us lacks more examples regarding the lessons since it is calculus more examples because it makes us understand more how to solve things,1
honestly so far she is a teacher i never wanted to have again although she is very intelligent no doubt for that but still as a teacher you should know to understand your students and try to put your feet in their shoes very high standard and strict,1
i like her while discussing topics but in terms of reaching her students concerns is not that good i am just trying to be honest here because its us who experienced such things she tends to embarrass student and doesnt accept her own mistake,-1
he is a nice instructor but mostly he has a favoritism in the class i bet it is not only me relates to this but he often have favoritism from i think five of my girl classmates but still at least he receive concern positively,-1
very inconsiderate teacher hindi nya maintindiha sometimes are mobile is very slow and sometimes approachable kasi if may concern kami hindi niya kami pinapakinggan,-1
does not respond immediately with the concerns raised by our classmates in neither group chat nor personal message posts redundant activities on lms yet gives low grades to student even though we submitted all activities,-1
he is a great teacher he often verbally appreciate our batch and that made us want to attend his class every sync he is also not a demanding pe teacher he respects our opinions and concerns thankyou sir,1
very professional she is a good example of a successful social worker yet sometimes pressures students with so much researches and activities does not give feedbacks on our outputs on lms,1
very calm every discussion and elaborates the topic or lesson very well nates classes and quizzes we are always productive with his class but he does not give extra points or at least give high grades,1
does not respond or give feedback with our outputs in lms or in gmail also no exact sched announcement for sync and async classes,-1
the best pe teacher,1
the best stat teacher,1
very smart and very active teacher yet sometimes so much work both synchronous and asynchronous classes also gives low scores to a very complicated activity which we put on so much time and efforts on,1
maam olga is a good teacher that has a good vision she ensures that her students will really learn something from her,1
learning is fun with doc that is why as a student i also enjoy every topic of discussion,1
maybe we can have a actual activities that relate to social responsibilities and good governance,1
wise lover of learners approachable and she is nice the way she teach and deliver her lesson and the approaches when it comes to the students,1
approachable he deliver the lesson well make the students astonished when it comes to the critical thinking questions and answers,1
he shows mastery of the lesson the most important is that he teaches his students how to become a good teacher someday and endeavor the approaches when it comes to the students are very decent and also a wise and intelligent teacher,1

he only attends for an hour during synchronous classes and makes us watch a youtube video when we do presentations of our projects he doesnt give any rubrics for the grading and clear instructions to students on what to do,1

knowledgeable and competent teacher,1
cilo should be discussed with students on the 1st day of classes the grading system is also needed to share with students on the basis of the grading system,1
thank you for sharing your expertise in research i have learned a lot from you,1
you deserve this grade because of this reasons,0
you make it difficult to your students to pass,-1
you say its all in the pdf but when we follow what u say its still wrong,-1
your way of teaching is not effective,-1
very passionate teacher,1
hindi pumapasok late madalas,0
isnt really an effective instructor opinions and concerns are not catered wellneglected doesnt provide an engaging atmosphere for students to learn criticizes them in a negative way,-1
he is such a good and effective educator,1
she should be more considerate,1
he is more on asynchronous mode,0
although she is more on recorded lecture but her discussions are wellexplained and understandable,0
he is not good at teaching and he always takes us down and scolds us because he says we cant get it and the score is always small,-1
if theres a zero i could have given zero one advisedo not enter the teaching profession if youre not into the job at all god bless,1
thank you i learned a lot from this course,1
thank you i learned a lot from this subject,1
hes good teacher but not updating in class and sometimes he will give late activities and giving small grades,1
the instructor makes her exam questions not found on the reporting and i find it unfair given a low grade due to low scores,-1
to be honest i think he did not made his job well he is inconsiderate and when we fail on something he laughed for me he is not matured enough in teaching,1
he is good but he gave more attention to his known student in class,1
sir alsola is a very professional teacher i have learned many things in taxation because of him the lessons may be hard considering that we are talking about tax but sir alsola made it easier also he is very passionate in his job thank you sir,1
uses varied teachinglearning activities to cater the students multiple intelligences and different learning styleslevel of ability,1
cant teach well,-1
always show youtube videos,0
not resourcefulness and innovativeness in classroom delivery,0
thank you miss i have a lot of learnings from you,1
sometimes is unwilling to listen to students concerns especially or meet them halfway especially with issues regarding lms,0
maam suello is a good instructor and very accommodating she always gives us motivation and gives ways to make the topic easier for us even though we know that accounting is very difficult,1
this instructor is so strict when it comes to the class we students cannot engage to her easily due to her strictfulness there is no emotion that comes to her when she is discussing to the class,-1
i wanted to say that this instructor makes me feel inconfident small and unmotivated she doesnt considerate any concerns of the students and very strict in everything also she doesnt accepts her mistakes i dont want her to become my instructoragain,-1
thank you dr alcantara for the patience in conducting stat classes online and for taking the time to ensure that we coped with stat using computer applications this will really help me a lot thanks doc,1

thank you sir,1
thank you miss,1
thank you miss sa mga related examples during discussion,1
thank you sir sa effort nimo during discussions para makasabot mi tanan,1
poor discussion,-1
always late in classes,0
good in discussions,1
he is very good listener to his students and he also give chances to students who encountered difficulties during online classes one of the best,1
as what i have observed during class this teacher doesnt show mastery of the subject she just only rely on book she also gave exams and quizzes which have not been discussed in the class which students find it difficult to answer,-1
as what i have observed this teacher doesnt use his full time to discuss the lessons he shortly discuss topics and lets the students do the rest of understanding the topics he mostly give students a 100 item exam with just a short span of time,0
she doesnt follow the school rule which is the synchronous and asynchronous mode of learning she always conducts synchronous sessions and rarely conducts asynchronous sessions,0
she brags about being the best online professor yet shes very inconsiderate what does she really means about being the best online professor in what aspect shes not open for reasons shes not approachable,1
hes very kind and approachable hes really considerate about things which makes him one of the best instructors that there is because intimidation means nothing if your students are intimidated theyre more scared rather than being participative,1
so far ms olaso is my favourite strict instructor although she has her own ways of disciplining us but i think its really effective because shes the type of person who encourages me to get out of my cage and be a free bird for freespeech,1
math isnt really my strong suit because im confused about numbers and reason to learn math along with the course ive chosen yet hes really good at discussing and really perfect visual aids i consider him as the second best math teacher,1
okay so it was interchanged this one is for mr allan romagos hes really sensible and very approachable and very considerate hes one of those precious gem in uc no one can ever take him away from us hes an effective instructor,1
because of her i believe in goodness,1
although hes up for really tiring exercises every week i understand because we only meet once a week but i cant deny that hes one of the best,1
i repeat no one can take mr allan doc allan away from us no one would ever want to lose this precious gem,-1
thank you doc osorno for imparting your knowledge and experiences to us i learned a lot from you god bless,1
thank you doc zapanta for imparting your knowledge and experiences and mastery of the subject i learned a lot from you and it was a great opportunity to be your student god bless,1
favorite instructor,1
we only met atty dandel once i believe this is due to her busy schedule,0
everything was done via modular activity but she was very responsive in email if we have concerns meeting us at east once a in awhile for discussion would be more helpful,1
displays integrity and confidence in her field,1
she is straightforward but smart very satisfactory performance,1
skills and competencies are extremely proficient,0
displays respect with good behavioral gestures,1
expert in business law,0
he never gives us information on our group chat if he has given us an activities assignments quizes or even in major exams so sometimes the task we submitted is often late and whenever it is late he deducted our scores of 50,0
i dont like her teaching methods periodt,-1
im not giving her perfect 5 because i know that she is busy as a dean of hospitality management she just rarely meet her students in her handled subject in hm 114 na bitin lang jud ko sa subject na iyang gi handle kay like ta nako ang fb na subject,-1
he is a good teacher and i like him for doing the feedbacking in our activities sad to say that i am not really good in accounting but i passed his subject pasang awa hahahahaha,1
i cant say anything but a perfect 5,1
perfect 5 fav teacher just like sir kevin hehe,1
she is very keen when discussing her lesson and is very considerate with our valid excuses sometimes,1
i really like you for being considerate sir keep it up despite learning difficulties in the learning modality honestly your subject is very convenient comprehensive precise and simple,1
i like your teaching style sir because you let your students visualize even though the mode is online as a student like me the way you elaboratedisseminate information is inadequate sometimes cant relate maybe the lessons are complex,1
hi maam i really love your teaching style thats it honestly i learned and familiarize the concept of descriptive statistics however comes to inferential wa gyud miss like tricky definitely learned some concepts that i didnt hear before,1
refrain from being mad or irritated every class,-1
the ability of sir al to create a positive classroom environment and to foster positive interactions with students,1
the use of formal education and he lectured us in very calm way and i also admitted i learned a lot from this class,1
he facilitated learning through studentcentered approach and used open discussions relating the topic to real life situation,0
i am grateful to have a kind and approachable instructor like ms piluchi and thankful for inspiring us always with the life lessons in nursing leadership and management process where i can apply and relate the ideas wherever i go,1
very professional as a instructors and i like the way of teaching of engr dennis lauta thank you so much sir,1
puts a lot of effort in discussing really appreciate it and shows interest in teaching,1
doesnt show interest in teaching always assumes that the students already know the topic which therefore wont be needing further discussion,-1
treats everyone equally and always start and end her classes with positive energy enjoyed her classes a lot,1
very knowledgeable in the field of business i have so much retention of his class he presents relatable examples during classes kind and considerate professor thank you so much doc,1
excellent professor thank you doc,1
i doc gem is such a wonderful teacher even though no naay times kulba kulbaan ta pero still na manage japun namko na maka kalma and tbh ang iya na subj ra gd na kalma kkaya ko aura,1
seen him once middle of the term rarely communicate with class,0
nice instructor,1
great instructor,1
very supportive and always motivates her students,1
thank you sa imoha natudlo namo maam regarding sa accounting subject pero usahay dili mi makasabot sa discussion kay ipa study ra nimo through online niya wala mi knowledge aning accounting ma kaayo medyo libogan mi gamay,1
i hope that she will teach the students properly like in giving the topic to be reported she only gives the title not the same with the usual teachers that give a picture of the bookcopies for the report but it give us challenges as a student thank you,1
have a nice day maam mendoza,1
i hope this teacher will try to be more considerate thats all,1
nindot unta mu tudlo si maam bonggot ang naka apan lang kay paspas ra kaayo sya mu disscuss murag ga apas sa oras gamay muhatag ug grado,0
she keeps hating our section,-1
bad teaching technique we never learned in his discussion because he only translate it into bisaya and he never explain it briefly and he never teach us how to code he only give us a problem and we never understood any of it he insult at his student,-1
great teacher teach us well like a professional hes pro in teaching and make us laugh he jams well very good teacher,1
amazing teacher shes a professional teacher shes kind and good,1
he motivates me so much i learned programming from him thank you sir joaquin,1
amazing teacher hes energetic and kindhe understand his students and he teach us well,1
her way of teaching is past faced and as a student who doesnt have any experience working in the bureau yet i find her way baffling significantly when she jumps from one topic to another every time she gives quizzesexams she provid a broad coverage,0
basahon rangppt unya translate ra gaexpect mi na daghan handson since major subject pero ang nahitabo puros written ang activity muragika3 rami kagamit sa pc dli sad sya reply samo concern via socmed ogsa personal dli mi tubagon tarung og naapay daghan,-1
he is not good at teaching and when he gives us a quiz the amount of time is very short,-1
overall hands up to his performance as a instructor to us,0
he is not good at explaining some topics in simple terms which causes us students to struggle with learning the lessons he provides he is also a poor communicator who cannot motivate us to learn more about his subject,-1
need to improve his teaching the way he teach us is like we are at the same level please i hope he will change the way he discuss the lesson dont just read your powerpoint most of your student need a broad discussion before to understand the lesson,1
i was just asking a question regarding in our class for that day she replies with an unappropriate way,0
my favorite teacher very calm,1
professor uses the internet on checking our research and we are not used to it because we use to have f2f corrections with our work so that we will exactly know what are the things that needed to revise professor is a very nice person to us,1
professor is a very nice person he ensures us that we are good in his class in having an activity that uses pc he gets a little bit angry if one of the students asks to do it again but i understand him because its not easy to teach i enjoy his class,1
teacher are not used to teaching so she doesnt know how and what to do with us but i can see her determination to understand our topic and interact with us at every meeting thank you for your time and efforts during our class,1
why did u hire her she is not fit to teach to be honest it gives her joy when her students fail we saw it ourselves she even complained about her salary in front of the class telling us that she is not afraid to be reported help us,1
shes not may be my favorite teacher but i like her much even though there are times that i cannot understand on how she teach but in a very long time i can keep up somehow i also like on how she speaks and illustrate situations,1
pinaka best and considerate teacher kudos to sirrr manos,1

best pe teacher i had hes very serious when it comes to physical education and always encourage us to do exercise to stay fit id love to have this pe teacher next semester,1
sir kerwin is a great teacher i could see how dedicated he is as a teacher,1
sir bobby tend to be lazy in the class he starts the class late and he seems to be bored and uninterested in discussing in class,-1
hes fit with the subject,1
he rarely discuss in the class and if he discusses he just sits down and will mumble anything and he doesnt care whether the students at the back will understand him,-1
hes a great teacher he really knows what hes discussing,1
hes a great math teacher i enjoy listening to him while he discusses,1
shes strict but she needs to since shes handling rotc shes a good instructor,1
shes good and jamming she treats us as her friends especially after class,1
he rarely discuss so were so behind in the lessons compared to other classes we only did investigative report until the midterm instead of a discussion,0
she gives low grades,-1
we learn a lot from her,0
we learn a lot when shes teaching us,0
mr tampus is considerate and gives high grades,1
she never fail to teach us she always do her best for us tysm miss,1
shes giving us a lot of activities and she gave us small grades,1
ah good teacher indeed and a very energetic teacher,1
she always gives us an activity then sometimes discussing and also she gave us small grades,0
gives us small grades,0
sir manuel is a very good teacher there is nothing to complain about,1
sir is okay it is understandable that he is busy as he is loaded but we students need more attention,1
she has exceeded my expectations for the amount of years i have been a student i would say one of my fave instructor in uc for the reason that she was able to clearly discuss the topic with us and made numerous points that we could use in the future,1
your expectations towards us maam is too high and you all do is to seat there and just holding your ballpen were not born in this world as an artist maam or what so you cant expect a perfect outcome with your activities dont expect us to learn that,-1
the best of the best,1
for prelim period we only had one activity and one group work where we are only given a short time to finish and for midterm we only had one quiz and the midterm exam and because of this the majority of us failed the subject and lose scholarship,-1
does not teach well,-1
i may not have high scores during in our major exams but this subject will be hard to pass due to the instructor in charge for the grades basis it will be only prelim exam one quiz and midterm exam because of this i lose my scholarship hoping for act,-1
i really like her teaching style she inspires me,1
first of all i thought mr lauta is what i expected that he is good at his job but he is not he dont discuss his lessons well and often give us very hard exercises especially in our prelim and midterm so he deserve to have a poor rating,-1
little to no feedback on individual concerns topics on exams are unclear and ambiguous,-1
her questionnaires sometimes are misleading and have several grammatical errors she is always late when attending our class like 30 minutes she is selling 3 pcs of newsprint for 5 pesos every major exam she is literally making money from us,-1
lack of teaching skills cant handle student very well always giving task with payments,1
sir diosfer is patient and considerate when it comes to his students he understands that students are not robots and we need time to do what needs to be done he always gives us the time we need to finish the plates he requires,1
sometimes its hard to understand the way she teach,-1
i am really confuse in thi subject because when miss is discussing the lesson she tend to zone out and insert another topic that is unrelated to the topic,-1
she is so moody cant handle students concern i cant understand the way she teach and the way she write,-1
the topic she discussed is i feel that it is not about the subject that i take in short i guess it is not fit for my course,-1
sir dennis really knows the topics he discusses but i dont think he knows that hes not delivering it properly he thinks the topic is easy but he doesnt understand that for us who are just learning it isnt,1
sometimes approachable sometimes can handle student he can give chance to the students to pass the lacking activities,1
he is the type of instructor that hard to approach because when you ask about the topic he just tell us mao jud lantawa makahibaw ra gud ka and he gave us grades that we dont deserve we gave our best but we can not bawi,1
he only gives us one activity to answer then the prelim and mid term exams dli mi kabawi sa among scores since gmay raman ang activity iyang gihatag namo,0
hes approachable can handle students concerns sometimes i cant understand the way he teach and sometimes he disregards students concern,-1
i cant understand the way she write cant understand the way she teachand sometimes cant handle students concern,0
mrs lucia is a very understanding instructor she wouldnt let us take our major exams in the exact exam week because she knows that we cant handle all the exams in just one blow she understands the students and is really great at communicating,1
sometimes he is lack of interest in teaching student and sometimes i feel like there are some favoritism between to my section and to the other section,1
sir andrian is a very chill professor he gives us time to do other things but hes also kind of strict especially when it comes to his quizzes hes very approachable especially in overriding mistakes in lms,-1
i dont like the way he teach sometimes he use some vulgar words to us,-1
miss is good in teaching but the way she gives activities is complicated because she didnt give the example or instruction on how to answer the activity,1
she doesnt consider even 1minute late to her class its automatically absent to her and she doesnt accept a 1 minute late activities and task,-1
she giving us a loaded task without thinking that we have many task to handle in other subjects,1
i know that shes very knowledgeable to what shes teaching but the way she teaches us is really ineffective she teaches us in a very fast pace without asking if we understood the lesson she taught,-1
i love how mam miriam discuss her lesson to usshe always inspire us with her motivational saying,1
not that good,-1
bagay dyud ka ma dean sir,0
angayan ka ma dean puhon sir,0

sometime i dont like him because he want us to remove our mask and in my case i dont like my mask tobe take off because i already had truma before because i git positive on covid,1
keep it up mam good well done maam,1
very understanding to us knows how to consider and she knows hoe to validation or feelings so thank you miss,1
hi sir good morning or afternoon sir thank you so much sir for being so understanding to us sir i really appreciate you sir and all the thing you do sir,1
the discussion wasnt always related to the quizzes and exams and the coverage of the exams are almost passive discussion not really focusing to the topic itself for us students could really understand and master the topic or discussion,1
thank you sa imong gipang tudlo miss caliwan even though maglibog ko usahay iay lagi d kay ko tig toon hahah pero thank you sa pag motivate namo maam,1

hi sir thank you kaayo sa imong gipangtudlo namo maynalang naa koy na learn slight haha og sa imong pagka komedyante sahay sir mwehehe,1
lamat sir,0
when our grades came out it was so unrealistic its like magic the students i know who i expected to have the highest grade got the lowest grade like what while those who dont give much efforts and have some errors on their ass got the highest grade,-1
hi miss thank you sa tanan,1
i think its better if she discuss the lesson before she give us a quiz its literally difficult for us to analyze some terms in the book and she dont give specific study materials or even page pls discuss 1st before giving us a quiz,1
it is quite unfortunate and disappointing that all of your asynchronous quizzes and most especially your major examinations were taken from an academic site quizlet we usually got low scores because questions are far different from our lessons,-1
i like how the way she teaches us she appreciates the reporters presentation very much shes kind to her student all goods ako kay maam nato hehe,1
shes an expert fair in grading all goods,1
pati kuwang og s ang method wrong pajud grabe ganahan siyag methods,-1
pati hierarchy wrong kay ganahan siyag hierarchies,-1

engr ledesma the kind of teacher that a student can easily understand the lessons by the way of his teaching skills i can say that hes an effective teacher,1
though maam bitoon is very fast in teaching topics that she can discuss more than 1day but shes the kind of teacher that a student can easily understand the lessons by the way of her teaching skills i can say that shes an effective teacher,1
a very excellent teacher,1
what you do is excellent by the way your dedication and enthusiasm are unfathomable i sincerely appreciate your assistance in bringing me through this difficult and quickly semester without it i would not have succeeded,1
this instructor is a good one she offers a wonderful balance of speaking listening and practical learning activities in addition to a very secure encouraging learning environment,1
i am not satisfied of the grade she has given me i am an academic scholar and a working studentcall center at the same time i tried to balance both acads and work however i really dont know why shes giving me a low grade when i put effort on it,-1
grading system purely based on quizes on youtube videos,0
didnt give effort to stretch his studentsgrades unlike other teachers doesnt have a single activity on face to face,0
she does not,0
we were given enough modules to understand our subject,0
i can say that she is very capable of this subject but the we learners sometimes cannot understand what she discussed because she is very fast when discussing,1
i hope next time on your class sir you will be properly discuss the topics sir and please ayaw na sig discuss sa imong life especially love life kay dli man sya relevant sa topics to be discuss sir hope u understand and thank u,1
i learn a little from this subject sometimes he just said to the class na bahala namo kasabot namo ana,0

very organized im inspired,1
teaches very well clear lessons and very considerate,1
she is an effective teacher,1
doesnt give any feedback on individual concerns no mastery of the subject discusses things not related to the lesson and provide exams far from the given examples during discussion,-1
no mastery of the subject discusses things not related to the lesson and provide exams far from the given examples during discussion hoping shell be considerate with the grades she is giving considering the students with scholarship,1
a very kind and understanding teacher we need more like sir jairee,1
the time of exams are so short that we have a trouble to score high like 25 question item test we just finished it for like 10 mins or so we can barely construct the question in our mind then eventually proceed to the next question fast,1

i thought he was the worst teacher nga nihandle namo but wrong akong impression because sir is very considerate and understand us students dili maka pressure iyang way sa pagtudlo,-1
at first sir is very strict but days passed nalessen iyang pagka strict and maka lihok nakag tarong like di na kaayo ka mapressure sulod sa room nice rasad si sir motudlo makat on sad ka kay each student pangayoan niya og opinion,1
nindot motudlo si sir but masobrahan lang jud ang iyang story time to the point nga mas naglabaw na ang story time kaysa sa lecture but sir is a nice and funny person prostudent sya and di sad ka niya i pressure og i hagbong,1
daghan kaayog ipabuhat si maam pero gamay kaayo mohatag og grado og mag discuss sya murag magdali permi kay magyawyaw ra di sad kaayo sya makig interact sa mga students ig mag discuss sya,-1

this teacher is so irresponsible dont have a consideration and also didnt communicate in students she super instrict but her teaching is so poor she just reading her discussion,-1

very offensive does not know how to teach forgets to upload materials for undiscussed lessons then proceeds to have midterm exams brushing off our complaints with ay kabalaka kay naay true or false a lot of us have failed because of this,-1
maybe this teacher is only for law students because the way she handle her class the teacher is hard to reach out and is not discussing properly and she always gives oral recitation without discussing the lesson,-1
very offensive does not know how to teach forgets to upload materials for undiscussed lessons then proceeds to have midterm exams brushing off our complaints with ay kabalaka kay naay true or false,-1
this teacher is hard to understand she doesnt use her knowledge to teach us so we can understand the lesson well actually accounting is difficult even if its just basic its more difficult because she didnt discuss it properly to us,-1
this teacher gives complicated questionnaire,0
miss diaz thank you for giving us a hard time activity we deserve it cause we are a college students so we should do our best to learn with it,1

lab works are completely irrelevant to the course we barely learned anything very offensive does not respect women or homosexuals extreme power tripper very by the book and does not consider correct answers that are not the exact words he might be an expert of his own skills but hes not qualified to teach his lectures consists of very slow that its tedious reading of the ppt with little to no explanations at all often times side tracks to a nonsensical or unrelated topic lab works are completely irrelevant to the course we barely learned anything very offensive does not respect women or homosexuals extreme power tripper very by the book and does not consider correct answers that are not the exact words,-1
lab works are completely irrelevant to the course we barely learned anything very offensive does not respect women or homosexuals extreme power tripper this comment is made not because i have low grades but purely stating facts,-1
i dont understand how heshe calculates our grades when we did our best and have not failed in any of his assignments and examinations,-1
lab works are completely irrelevant to the course we barely learned anything very offensive does not respect women or homosexuals extreme power tripper quizzes and exams are literally word by word identification and is irrelevant to the subject,-1
best instructor no doubt,1
i am very grateful to be one of mr trinidads students because his teaching skills are very effective he always explains his discussions briefly but clearly also siya ang type na teacher na approachable kaayo tapos he also helps us na ma improve mi,1
i gave her almost 1 ever since i step in her class i didnt see her discuss instead she divided us by group and that is not the problem the problem is after we discussed she didnt correct whenever there are mistakes instead she directly give quizes,1
he was a good teacher because he explains will and he gives acceptable grades and lessons to us,1
discussion is irrelevant to the subject i were told by my batchmates that are now 4th year students that they were taught about computer hardware we arent learning about hardware at all on this subject,0
sir mendoza is a very approachable teacher if we ask some questions regarding to the topic he definitely provide us an answer and he teach well he explain word to word,1
she is creative during our activity sessions yet iwe cant understand her well when she discusses the topic,1
to be honestly he is very strict we dont like him because he treat us differently i know that different teacher so different lesson we are jealous to the other section because their topic is different from us we have a very difficult topic,-1
maam hope is very kind and the way she teach us we will able to understand the lesson is she teaching,1
he discusses well and after the discussion we will have an activity to practice our minds on what we learned,1
i dont know if he ever been teaching college students before as his teaching skillsmethod is only applicable to kinder school students,1
maam jas is good in teaching the problem is the way she teach she is so fast and sometimes we are scared of her but all in all she teach us well but sometimes during exam her questioners are different there are topic that she wasnt able to discuss it,1
sir delposo tries his best in explaining the topic over all he does a good job,1
sir viodor is quite strict but he does a good job especially in explaining the topic,1
ga semi final nalang wa jd siya naka discuss sige lag exam bisag way gitudlo,-1
he let us report our topic and then after the reporting he will further discuss the lesson also we regularly take quizzes,0
bisag paspas kaayo siya mo storya kay makasabot japun ka niya kay nindot motudlo,0
to be honest i havent learn something in forsci he always talk about his life not just ones but during his classes since day 1 if he diffidently dont know you he will gave you a small grade i dont like him and the way he teach,-1
i dont understand the lesson well the way he deliver his lesson was just too fast we cant cope up easily he gave us activities but we dont understand the lesson i believe that our scoresgrades reflects on how the instructor teaches us,0
i like her but i dont like the way she teach she always give us activities and yet she gave us small grade we are very stress with her subject i think she dont give appropriation to our efforts,0
sir trinidad does a good job he teach as well he discusses the topic well and he relate the topic in a real life situation sir trinidad is kind and approachable teacher,1
miss jarlyn does a good job she makes sure that we are able to understand the lesson she teach us,1
i havent learn something with his subject he will give us link to his youtube channel and watch his videos their it is inappropriate way to teach right he will just let us watch the videos of him teaching about the topic we did everything we could,0
sir arnel teaches us effectively but his test are sometimes complex its solvable but we need more time because his doesnt require calculator and thats why thats all i just need to bring out by all means but hes a good guy thank you,1
her way of teaching is not suitable in hm students,0

the best couldnt say more bcoz sir deserves so much appreciation from us thank you sir,1
1,0
a very kind teacher i know,1
one of the best teacher ive ever had so friendly and discuss everything carefully,1
a great teacher will never feel bored during his class hours,1
one of the best teacher always has a lot of energy,1
such a wonderful teacher might sometimes dont understand some of the discussions because really dont know so much in logic but she always understands you in any excuses you will say she also encourages students,1
i hate to say it but his overall performance is really awful and offensive to my financial support he does nothing but translate all lessons written in english and ironically he doesnt allow late comers but comes in late himself,-1
i dont know all the topics of our subject or what to do like the activities or projects that relate to our topic but why is it our topic for almost the whole semester was just solving about converting binary from octal to decimal to hexadecimal,-1
di mo sud sa online og 30minutes ra magklase sa f2f mao ranay problema hope ma fix soon,-1
i really love how she teaches us,1
he is good with guiding us to this subject,1
goood teacher at first i thought she was a terror teacher but as the days go by i got to know her and her personality better as a teacher,1
i like how our instructor teaches us to this topic he always do board work for us to be trained and yes it is quite effective because i got good grades,1
he teaches us so smoothly,0
dimada sir dastruc oy grabe,0
salamat sir,0
lamat sa lessons nga among nakayt unan sir,0
miss enricoso is so good in teaching shes so hands on to us like if we have queries or questions she really do respond and take actions to it,1
she only want each one of us to report the lesson and let us handle the quizzes also we also want her to discuss the lesson for us to understand more so far i never see her discuss for us,1
great teacher good instructor her teaching method was so smooth so considerate we really have fun every discussion all i can say best instructor so far,1
hindi nya nag che check ng attendace bihira lang mag discuss liit ng grades namin kasi bihira lang mag pa gawa ng mga activities at tsaka napaka attitude feel na feel nya ang oagka high standard nya hindi kami namo motivated dahil sa asal na pinapakita ny,1
his one of my favorite instructor,1
wish to have proper grades next sem,1
i like the way he teaches us,1
wish to learn more about you maam and your lesson,1
made the students learn accounting on their own thinks the students can learn accounting on their own never lecturing cant be reached online and too temperamental for students to ask their questions f2f have not learned a single thing from her,-1
way lain ma say kundi the best ie instructor,1
self study,0
were shocked about our grades that he gave to us and many of us got failed grades even though we have score and always participated on the activities that he gives answer every quiz that we did and also we didnt conduct a examination,-1
makasabot jud mi sa lessons kay welldiscussed siya and maayo mo explain si sir in a way nga iyahang examples ihatag namo is easy to understand jud so that sa amoanv quizzes and exams maka answer sad mi,-1
self study no ppt and no discussion,-1
great teacher,1
the best oy way lain ma say slay miss pretty unta ikaw amoa teacher next sem,1
selft study no ppt and no discussion he gives topic to study only,-1
pinakachill nga instructor sa tanan yet maka learn jud ang mga students da best,1
does not know how to teach the subject correctly he only reads it then translate it to cebuano no elaboration and no contact in any social media platform even in lms,-1
engr poltergeist is a very nice teacher no words can explain how lucky are we in his class because he ensures that we will understand his discussion he is the best instructor ive met so far in my college life,1
engages the students to give their own ideas explains the lectures with great clarity conciseness actually makes the student think about the subject class is interactive and fun,1
okay raman unta siya pero different ang learning capabilities sa students like others dili kamao sa memorization then ang uban maka learn through hands on ang uban di maka learn without guidance etc most of the time pabasahun mig taas nga chapter,1
okay man sad si sir sa iya profession,-1
okay si miss nga proffesor kay if naay mga students nga wala kasabot kay mu explain siyag maayo then kalma saf siya pagka prof,1
di mag klasi sigeg pangasaba bisag wami ge buhat sayop sige lag reporting,-1
sir gungob cannot discuss like a teacher when he discusses he is like a student who does not study his topic he reads his entire ppt and translates it into our native language and expects us to understand his discussion also he uses foul words to us,-1
okay sad si miss sa iya lesson kay organize,-1
her grading method is really unjust we received failing grades despite our best efforts to understand and achieve higher score,-1
okay kaayo sir naningkamot siyag discuss namo bisag wala siyay background sa java programming nakasabot raman sad mis iya discussion,-1
okay sad si sir kay iya ma explain maayo iya mga topics namo tapos iya e relate iyang mga activities sa among course,-1
she loves surprised quizzes and reporting,1
i love the way she handles our class she always think about our mental health she listens to our opinions and rants,1
i enjoyed his class the most,1
i cant easily approach her maybe because mahadlok ko niya pero overall okay raman pero naa lay times nga paspas ra kaayu siya nya dili mi kaapas,0
very polite and considerate teacher,1
atty bragat exerts more effort in attending all our face to face and online classes he use our dialects and circumstances more relatively which helps us understood the lesson tackled in each session,1
need more energy in delivering the informations of our history because most of the time the discussion is dull and less engaging,1
her grading method is extremely unfair we put our extra effort to study the stuff she gave us even tho she didnt discuss it thoroughly we did our very best to get good results yet she still gave us grades we didnt deserve,1
she gets angry every time we ask her questions about a certain task,-1
whenever theres a certain activity dugay sila maka announce ganahan naa dayon for me kalas pd ug kwarta ang activities nila,1
maam leah is such a wonderful teacher you can actually learn a lot from her especially in terms of computer skills,1
best teacher so far,1
the most handsome joyful amazing teacher i met so far,1
she is a good teacher but sometimes doesnt know how to approach her students very well i dont want to say that shes strict maybe she is just a perfectionist,1
i like how sir jigger teaches us i understand mathematics even more because of him he knows how to make his students more calm and confident,1
excellent teacher lloydie,1
she is a good teacher she is very active in class maybe she needs more courage and confidence to communicate with her students,1
the way she talks sometimes are too fast for us to cope up with the discussions,0
sometimes the exams are too far from what has being discussed,0
sir bryle knows how to communicate with his students he knows how to catch the attention of the class but i just hope he will be more thorough with his decisions and opinions,1
the exams are not aligned with the discussion its so difficult said that study definition of terms and then the exam is problem solving,-1
maam gemma is such a wonderful teacher she always makes sure that everyone is feeling at ease during the discussion,1
ms princess is a good instructor i admire her how she handle our class shes of the reason why im not afraid anymore to speak in front,1
she is a responsible teacher she knows how to teach us properly she is also a considerate teacher,1
sir danillo is a great teacher he knows how to catch our attention he is also a very considerate and openminded teacher,1
in this subject i can rate to my subject teacher a good 4 because his performance cannot satisfied me,1
good teacher but need to explain more her discuss that cannot base what is the inside of her powerpoint,1
i learned more in this subject in the other term i learned more how the teacher good to teach there student,1
they can teach there student how to do in a good performance they correct everythings wrong in every performance of the students,-1
everything is good,1
she discuss it properly and step by step to get know how to solve in that problem,-1
all goods haha,1
what they can teach i cannot satisfied because they cannot explain ot property,-1
the type of teacher that will encourage its students to do well and their very best he exhibit mastery towards the subject and really knows it well,1
always mad at class,-1
he only give youtube video to study and have an exam for just 30 mins in every f2f class and also he often use foul words when someone make mistakes,-1
in my opinion the way he teaches is not effective for me even if we do not understand the lesson well he still continues to open a new topic he also has low voice we cannot clearly hear what sir is talking or discussing about,-1
her teaching method is not effective for me she always talk about other things so she doesnt have enough time to clearly discuss the topics in this subject,0
sir joaquin is the best teacher he feeds us with knowledge step by step until all of us understand best teacher the best,1
a gentle and strict teacher but kind to students and understanding to their situations,1
the best chill and can understand the students circumstances,1
an excellent teacher i must say his teaching is very effective he is also approachable he cheers us up and i can say his mastery for this subject is great,1
excellent teacher and very professional,1
very professional topics well explained very approachable and one of the best teachers no words can explain how good he is as a teacher to us,1
very openminded approachable and consistent with her strategies,0
provides projects and assignments which can enhance our learning very nice to the students and approachable,1
a professional teacher but i would not say the best,-1
always the student does the reporting she just sits back and does nothing she gives us exams or tests immediately whenever she liked like her ego gets ahead and her pride is more important than the teacher why did you hire her shes not professional,1
his subject is always selfstudy and youtube although he gives us lectures but only a few most of the time exams which is very hard to do because the time limit is very small compared to the difficulty of the questions also a stubborn person,-1
im hoping she can add a quizzes time for her students because she only gives us 20 minutes for our long quizzes with 30 questions also i hope she will allow us to give a chance to her all quizez for those who are absent for emergency reasons,1
ms gob has a very huge impact on my physical health as she was very kind and understanding she also exert discipline by only giving 15 minutes of grace period on those who came in class late,1
nothing to say,0
too strict to the point it burdens us students,-1
shes good,1
i love this professor i love the way she teach and explain hands up to this professor,1
hes good,1
her type of teaching is ineffective based on my experience,-1
hes so cool hands up to this professor,1
her teaching skills need to improve but shes a good professor,1
i really love her since shes very open and i really like the vibe she has within that makes me feel energize during her class,1
i really love her also and her personality since she really can relate to us and the way she handles us was very impressive and that i have so many learnings and advices from her that i really followed,1
i love this teacher also as he is so careful to us and the way he explains the lessons was do interesting as i can get it all the time,1
my only concern of this subject is our room because this will be the reason sometimes why we are late in his class because my classmates and i are not really familiar with the place because we are freshmen,0
sir margallo is one of the professors who can make a student enjoy his class and he knows when to joke and when to be serious he also shows mastery in teaching his subject his class is one of my favorites because he considers his students welfare,1
he never attend the online classes he only attend during face to face classes,0

your humor makes our class engaging and not boring thank you,1
you shouldnt let us discuss or report all the topics because its ur role to give us the knowledge but i really appreciate that somehow u discuss the topics after the reporting,1
she is very negligent in extent to what ive heard to all of her classes and heavily rely on students on learning she never once teaches us students and often blames us for the low scores in exams quizzes and assignments,-1
very carefree and all lab classes of him are very useless it is always either a quiz or online activity and if its discussion he simply reads it to the class learning is relied on us students and we never learned anything from him,0
he is decent in this class but is very slow and timeconsuming during discussions he discusses quarter of the lesson and leaves the rest for us to study his quizzes and exams are the most infuriating because of the little time to answer a lot of items,-1
very impressive teacher although i seomtimes disagree with his practical exams because sometimes its unjustifiable and unfair to students with low comprehension like me,-1
gamay mo hatag grado,0
shes really okay but giving an grade to the student so small even your score is really great,1
sir so really a great history teacher he explained everything about the history even is not in the book hes going to explain to make us clear understand,1

mr alapag is my favorite teacher because aside from the fact that he is our major subject teacher he also is very puctual and understanding to us his students,1
there have been several complaints about this teacher her teaching methods are not a very student friendly,-1
mrs minyamin really introduced higher subjects related to our course really well she made it more exciting however i wish she would give us harder examples during discussions bec her quizzes are too hard,1
she is kind and okay but the way she teached us is just in very high standards i know some of us is slow learner every week is oral but she didnt really do some discussions overall self learning is just sucks for us it so draining,-1
its okay that he teaches then every day you update him if there is an assignment even if hes not in your class or online,1

her way of teaching is very impressive and completely discuss the topics clearly good job mam and thank you for the grades,1
sir durano is one of the profs tha i look up to as he is really good however he doesnt grade our activities properly and are not recorded,1

worst teacher ever dont know how to handle students who is mentally break down,-1
his teaching method is not recommendable every time he presents he just reads and translates the powerpoint presentation and in every lab he doesnt teach us he just gives us a piece of paper to follow,0

i really appreciate how maam raquel taught us the lesson that we have to learn she approaches us professionally and also inspire us to keep on striving and to reach our goals,1

sir junix presents himself professionally what i like about sir is that he pushes us in a way that we can learn and not pressured one of the best teacher ive been under with,1
to be honest sir ting is a good teacher but the way he teaches students is not really engaging and hard to catch up the way he expoundexplain something is hard to understand and would say aloud our grades without even asking us students if its okay,-1
sir kevin is one of my favourite teacher he is very professional and fun at the same time he knows how to handle a boring discussion and make it interesting the way he teaches makes it easy for us students to understand and reflect on,1

ms tampon is indeed a good teacher hard lesson can be understandable and become easy to us keep it up maam 3,1
i honestly admit that im afraid of her because behind her beautiful and sweet face i can see her as a terror but when the discussion starts her topic is very interesting because it involves cases and reallife situations all in all shes good 3,1

mr ronnel is one of the best teacher that i have met ever since then he taught me to love the course hes teaching us i really taught that history was boring back then not until mr ronnel came,1

excellent professor he understands and appreciate all of the students efforts,1
test answers has many errors which we arent sure if she corrected it it caused us to have low grades,-1
best teacher,1
he never discuss always resorting to reporting wherein no additional information will be given after group reporting rarely attends our online class schedules,-1
this instructor is extremely unapproachable do not accepts comments and recommendations above all never consider her students with their acceptable reasons she is one of the reason why we her students are so drained now she is not a motivation at all,-1
fun and best teacher,1
in this world full of depressing instructor sir carlo is our saviour,-1
he is our rest the one we can lean on during our darkest times such an inspiration,1
shes one of the best teacher that ive known she thought us in a direct way and has this good attitude when correcting the students,1
shes the right minus wrong teacher but i see it as a motivation and challenge eventhough i got low scores it might seem to other students that shes merciless or whatever bad comments its her rules and she just taught us how to be responsible,0
hes one of the best teacher ive known uc is lucky to have him here he has this effective way of teaching and have this good vibe,1
i like her attitude and the way she explained her lessons she may seem to young but shes more than a professional one,1
she is a very terrible professor who holds a grudge on her students she deducts her exams duration on the slightest movement of a single student she is very unfair i personally think she does not take us seriously because its her last semester here,-1
choy kaayog tupi si sir,0
she sometimes doesnt answer our concerns and doesnt give consideratins and sometimes answers us with insult,-1

ive noticed thst the instructor on this subject is always late in entering our class and sometimes the performances would greatly be sffected because of lack of time,-1
his not the kind of teacher that what ive been expected you give your best to have a high grades in his subject but for him it is not satisfying enough when you are going to chat him or contact him about your concern he is not responding,-1
she is a kind of teacher that will motivate you why and how education is very important for me she is good teacher,1
i am not satisfied enough for him when it comes to teaching,-1
miss leah is a great computer teacher i genuinely enjoy her class shes very approachable and kind too she caters to students having trouble with their activities she even gives extension of deadline especially when the activity is quite hard,1
i like how she became relatable but the only problem is she becomes consistently late thats why we cant perform out tasks on time she sould be tardy always,-1
i suggest that she could be more comprehensive and deliver reallife situations so she can be relatable to everyone for us to learn easily also she needs to lower her standards because we are all doing our best and it is evident to her students,1
she is a good teacher but she rarely attends our classes i know she has the capability but due to her being so busy we rarely meet her i wish we could formally have our class everytime and lower her standards as well,-1
i really like maam fabio she deserved to be given full score kay kahibalo siya unsay need ug unsay angay buhaton sa usa ka student if dili makasabot or wala kasabot sa topic shes friendly pud na makahatag ug encourage sa mga students thank you,1

no talking about our grade sir just put the grade and dont inform us what the possible grade we get one thing after we saw our grade in the portal we asked him why our grade was like that and he said because of the missing quizzes in google classro,-1
ineffective way of teaching in fact she doesnt discuss the subject thoroughly impractical way of evaluating and assessing students knowledge this is a management subject theory and concept identification is no longer applicable in exams,-1
our subject doesnt only rely with identification of theories we need activities type of exams that we are able to apply those whats on the book since this is a mgmt subject where we will really think that were already in the corporate world applyit,0
so strict,0

he only reads and translate the ppt we do our own research but it still hits different if explained by teacher letter c number 5 about refraining us from vulgar word we dont say vulgar words to him he is the one that says vulgar words to us,1

please let us use calculator when conducting the exams and please let us have enough time in the exam because not all of us are smart even if we study some of us arent really fast enough to solve each of your test itriedmy best to study butistillgotlow,1
i submitted what is needed to be submitted but yet that wasnt enough i got low grades yet i tried my best,1
please maam dont throw your anger at us we tried our best to not make you angry but still its not enough for you but thank you for being a good teacher,1
honestly sometimes he uses vulgar words in classes the way he thought us database is not effectively useful for the next semester so we are concern if we ever fail in this subject without him giving his best and attention to us,-1
good so far,1
very good teacher when it comes teaching,1
she is a good teacher that she will review the topic before the quizzes or exam so that we are all reminded but she has a lot of quizzes,1
she is a good teacher kind but she has a lot of assignments to be submitted in lms,1
he is always energetic when he is inside in our classroom he dont want us to be pressure in his subject he is a good teacher,1
she should invest a lapel because her voice is so low that almost all of us cant hear what shes discussing thus we barely understand our lesson the whole semester and shes always busy on her laptop hope this will reach her incase shes not aware,1
she is not considerate type of teacher she just reading her ppt and discuss it shortly and often it is not understandable i dont like how we take our exam in this subject because its a right minus wrong which has a big impact to our score,-1
he accept everyones opinion everytime he discuss and he also always asking question to us to give our opinion,1
shes not good at delivering the discussion we cant barely understand our lesson bec of that plus she shows attitude on the class that makes her unaproachable which she must not coz shes a psych major,-1
he is energetic everytime he discuss he is well prepared for the activities and lastly he dont pressure us in this subject and find a simple ways for us to understand his lesson,1
she is good teacher but in this subject it has a lot of activities to submit everyweek,1
he is good teacher and kind person,1

the only database subject where we rarely code and talk about principles when it comes to designing and constructing databases memorization of definitions word for word is completely irrelevant to this subject kind of sexist too,0
teaching methods are kind of clunky but learning outcomes are still quite conducive one of the best programming instructors you could have despite the shortcomings this instructor couldve given,1
i like sir emmans teaching style it made the subject more interesting,1
this subject does not only stop on merely identifying the theories i hope we can have activities and exams that are more practical where we are able to relate and apply these terms and our learnings in the real world,1
since every student learns differently i hope that maam pagobo will be more understanding where everyone can keep up with the lessonstelling your students they will fail is not a good idea since it will only cause them to react negatively and to overth,-1
sir alo should be more specific in giving instructions and giving feedbacks to students to avoid confusion,1

very good and beautiful teacher,1
he has a good sense of humor but his grading system standard is too high which makes our grades lower even though i got 8595100 scores with perfect attendance and almost perfect in all activities but still i got 20 but its okay,1
very nice to students,1
mrs trismegistus hernando may seem intimidating but is really a competent effective and fun teacher,1
mrs nenette alvarez is a kind and understanding instructor she discusses well and tries to dispense more explanations to those that have a hard time comprehending the lesson,1
mrs rocel p pedoche is one of the highly commendable and remarkable teachers that i have had she discusses well and provides a variety of learning methods such as fun and engaging activities and games she is very competent and effective,1
mr dennis lauta may seem soft at first but is really intimidating when you get to know him he believes when you fall behind him you must get up on your own and catch up to him however putting these aside he is a competent instructor,-1
mr larry angelo caete is a good teacher despite a few drawbacks,1
dili mo consider sa mga students nga wala pa naka buy ug book nagkalisud pa intawn mig ngitag money,0
i dont like how he approach to my classmates he is also very strict on the outcomes of the scores he is not contented by the students performance even though mao ra ang makaya,-1
di kaayo mo tudlo patanaw rami sa youtube pasalamat gani ta kay face to face na kay slow kaayo ko online dayon patanawn ra diay gihapon ta online dipajd mag meeting every synchronous session,0
i dont like the way he give grades to us most of us got almost perfect in every exam and got like 2 wrongs or 3 but he consider that as a zero so he gave us 25 or 30,0
the very buotan and considerate teacher ive ever met in my entire life,1
thank you sir you always find a way to make sure that your students learn from your lesson and its not only about academic but also about real life situation you never get tired for giving us some advice on how to succeed in college life,1
some of mr pacaldos instruction are not clear and confusing he doesnt give consideration to the students and does not listen when the student is explaining hisher side thats what i have observed during his classes,-1

best teacher,1
thankful to be one of your student,1

i highly respect engr quimera but i believe that she should not suddenly give identification type exams if its not announced although i admit that she did remind us to study our lessons however the exams she give would usually be multiple choice type,1
the best teacher weve had this semester,1
he understands the situation of the students which i really like about him he listens to the students and give advices that could change life for the better he is really a standard as a role model as a teacher,1
our recent test paper says it all spoiled bratt feeling gwapa nya bugo deay i still have the test papers where she put the offensive words please contact me if u want to see and please keep this confidential 09086343089,1

thank you sir bragat i have learned a lot from u,1
i hope she will change her teaching method for us to understand well and i hope she will change her right minus wrong because my scores are very low and i hope she will consider that many of us struggling of major subject and not all of us can do it,1
i hope you can do the topic easy and understandable i hope your quiz will be easy and have choices and not situational everytime,1
i hope your research is easy,1
hinay kaau og tingog usahay bisag ma lapel pa,0

so far in this semester this teacher is my favorite because she gave me high grades though i know i deserved it i deserved the grades ive got because she made me listen to her class and got me very inetrested on how she discussed the topic very calmly,1
thank you sir for being a one step ladder to achieve our aim,1
one of my favorite teacher because she literally helps me to higher up my grades shes the type of teachers wholl understand and give you a chance and also shes a soft spoken kind of teacher shes lovely,1
g jb ako po ay tauspusong nagpasalamat na naging bahagi ka ng hakbang patungong katapusan,-1
im a little bit disappointed to this teacher because shes a scam she once told us that shell be giving us plot one but yhen i got 25 and got very disappointed because i find her subject quite hard also we student are the one whos discussing always,-1
hi miss i hope you wont change i honestly hate art at first but since you enlighten me up at all thank you for doing that,1
this teacher is very funny we dont have a clear discussion fron her subj but we always chika shes so cool but ive got a lower grade from her a little bit disappointed but fine shes good in the f2f class but not in online ang gc,1
hi maam even if you call me out of the blue maam for oral recitation my brain will actively function from spacing out and thank you for such a blessing in disguise in that way,1
i dont have a problem with this teacher because she delivered the topics well and shes amazing in math subject but ive got a low grade of her 22 please do tell her that im trying my best to understand math for her but its really difficult sigh,1
sir i would like to apologize for what ive done is very embarrassing during in the session because of my right ear didnt function it well and thank you for being patience sir,1
sir thanks although you have a little bit of strict but in a manner keep it up sir,1
the teacher only reads her discussion never minding if we understand something she did her best to be engaging in the classroom i hate this subject because theres a lot of money needed its not a major but its very expensive,1
i love how she value respect fairness and the safety of her students she knows wether it is fair or not and she has a strong opinion and shes brave i love her shes strict all the time and im always afraid to her and to the rules of this subj,1
i love how he handles us calmly and to how he interrupt the discussion just to pit his own observation or knowledge of the topic hes a father kind hes bubbly and joker though i have a low grade from him i still adore this teacher,1
hi miss thank you for lighten up myday,1
i am a student of well respected university of cebumain campus who is suffering anxiety and depression right now because i have failed in this subject i dont know why when i am doing my best or maybe my best wasnt good enough for her,1
sir thank you for sharing the reallife joke sir in that way we easily learn the lessons,1
shes pretty and jolly and she knows and delivered our subject well i love how she try to joke but not funny at all shes cute though and shes really good and smart to her profession i looked up to her,1
one of the best teacher i have had,1

one of the best teacher i have had,1
this is the type of teacher where im always shock because as he said he likes pointing to student while hes discussing you might get shock because he will just yelled while point diba and then the rest of the class will laughed ive got a 15 hehe,1
hahaha sensya na pero wajuy ayo,1
atty hope is the standard,1
i love sir so much,1
smart but not for teaching,1
even though all of my activities were complete i still received low grades,-1
he is a very good teacher who relates discussions to realworld situations however he is very vulgar with his words frequently using many curse words,-1
he is a very good teacher discusses topics that is easy to understand for everyone and is also very generous in giving grades however he can easily be put into a sulking mood even walked out once which is very unprofessional,1
he doesnt care if his class understands the discussion as long as he can discuss and then give activities or exams there are also topics sometimes during discussion that even him doesnt quite understand,-1
chaka siya mo discuss tapos iyang mga topic is out the class quiz like layu kaayu siya mo discuss and then gamay kaayu muhatag ug grades bisag gi effortan sa estudyante ug buhat ang mga plates gagmay kaayu,1
the way she manage the subject depends on her mood,0
this is just a honest review of mine as a student under by miss jellie shes not passionate on her job as a teacher itself as is lng nga maestra siya naay sweldo as gora na as in shes not ready for discuss di kahibaw mo discuss wa siya kahibaw,-1
so far so good si sir clofer he taught us the right learners that we need,1
shes not on her job shes no compassion i dont see any dedication of learning from her,1
i gave her 3 rates because miss jellie is so demanding of project and costly kaayu iya ipahatag na project as ie we are not oblique to make sa miniature but iya jud mi gipahimu and its demand our allowance tapos muhatag ra siya ug gamay time to make,-1
she uses vulgar words when one of my classmate discuss their reporting she even tore 5 of my classmates midterm exam just because they are late passing it in front she didnt value her students effort,-1
daghan kaayo moh,0
ill rate 1 for miss jellie because during our time ipa adto mi nya sa campus tapos ipa search ra diay buhaton dimag discuss and ni hangyo mi nya sometimes eh online but reklamador daw mi and shes not approchable and she set favoritism,0
hes a very good teacher,1
please kick sir mendez to the campus he gave us traumatizing through the grade even though we do our best but gagmay kaayu siya hatag grado manghagbong pa dili siya approchable tapos libog kaayu siya mga choices masuko pajud pangutanonpls kicksir mendez,1

i dont actually like how he handle our class we always do oral recitation without doing discussion he just gave us something to watch but dont discuss it entirely i hope he also give consideration when it comes to our late submissions,1
shes very strict and religious person i think shes very studious kind of a person but the way she has way more expectations to us students and we couldnt probably achieve that,0

love arts but sometimes the attitude matters love the subject but the person in this subject sometimes cant be understand,1
as teacher they are to look up but sometimes a discouragement because of the voice that is too little,-1
and not easily to communicate,-1
always late or there are times that hell be absent without notifying us,-1
so far so good he genuinely wants the student to learn and even if i received a poor grade at least he didnt fail me,1

lack of mastery on the subjects being handled always unprepared on her discussion and unsure of what to do or say needs to undergo training to improve her ways of teaching,-1
always speak english,0
lack of mastery on the subjects being handled always unprepared or unsure of what to do or say always make the students do research activity during f2f and havent done a single discussion on the topics of the subjects,-1

showed mastery on the subjects being handled his way of teaching is simple yet the student will surely get something very informative at the end of the discussion,1
displayed mastery on the subjects,0
no room for improvements to the students because of the fact that she rarely goes to class and the audacity to give my classmates failings grades or barely passing grades and here i thought uc is the center of development please observe this teacher,-1
superb way of teaching engage more to physical activities than lecture which is nice in order for the student to have at least time to engage themselves in physical activities,1

miss i love your way of teaching but i hope that from now on you return our activities so that we can analyze our grades based upon our scores because i cannot think of a way that i had it low since they were pretty basic yet i had a low grade,1
less discussion but lots of quizzes and activities,0

he is a good teacher but when it comes in grades nagbase lang po sya sa percentage nang lms scores not in f2f activities,-1

she doesnt give face to face discussions and only gives us videos to watch and its really disappointing because she doesnt entertain questions regarding the lesson cant really fill the educational needs that the students need in order to learn,-1
pls listen to his stdents he does not reply to emails and messages on messenger and lms when asked to recheck and reconsider a quiz as many students got 0 because of the unclear instructions he said he will reconsider if he is in a good mood,1

sir is so dedicated in teaching that he uses all the time we have just to discuss the lessons we need to learn he also accepts students suggestions and concerns regarding certain things,1
sir mendez gives some files in lms for our reference but he doesnt discuss the topics very well hell just read the files he put in lms to us in our face to face class he doesnt review the answers weve given in the quizzes or exams,-1
he once gave us an exam in which we had to write our code on paper without discussing anything beforehand the answer was then provided to us at the following meeting but the code he provided contained numerous errors and couldnt be run,-1
though sometimes ma pressure mi sa iyang eh pang hatag na modules na always everyday deadline i will still give him 5 he is excellent teacher i see the bright side of him he is understandable towards on his students,1
why i give him 5 i give him this because he is so considerable prof makita nimo niya na kahibalo siya mo lantaw sa isa ka studyante like wa ni gina pressure iya student sana all in ani nga maistro no hehehe god bless,1

ay ok hehehe god bless,1
her teaching style is good she explains the lessons well enough and relate it to real life situations but sometimes she fails to consider some circumstances that occurs during online class and asynchronous sessions like slow internet and etc,1
walay discussion puro quiz every meeting,0
i learned a lot from miss leah about computers,-1
we cant apply what we have learned in his subject because the questions in his exams are usually not in the book which is the major source of our lessons his exams are far from what we have discussed and the result is reflected on our grades help,1
always makes things harder for us like iya gyud ming lisod lisoron ug maayu ug ang mga questions sa iyang exam kay lisod kaayu eh process on a different level iyang mga questions sa exam and its out of our league,1
she dont know how to handle her students perfectionist kaayo pagka maistra nga ma abot sa point nga if ma sayop ka gamay pakauwawan ka shes one of the reason nganong ganahan kaymi mo balhin og skuylahan kay maka trauma iyang batasan,-1
he dont know how to handle his students dili kahibaw mo dawat og opinions sa mga studyante og dili kahibaw mo consider kusog kaayo mangutana sa studyante pero di mag klase,0

happy to be in miss sincos class before graduating she teaches well she makes complicated topics easy to understand she is a considerate teacher she empathizes with her students overall she is an outstanding teacher,1
shes by far the best law teacher i have encountered throughout my college years here at uc main campus im glad i was able to experience her teachings although her exams are quite difficult she makes her discussions easier to understand,1
shes an excellent teacher hope she stays longer in uc main campus so that other students will be aware of how nicely she handles her subjects students can learn a lot from her,1
hes giving unreasonable grades,1
her exams are difficult and far from what she discusses i hope she sticks to the references she provides,1

she is always late or never goes to our class and she give us small grades,0
she gave us small grades when in fact she is just reading the powerpoint presentation when discussing,0
we dont deserve the garde we received we did our part and we know that we dont deserve it,0
he always make sure that the students understands the lesson he is also approachable,1
he doesnt respond to some concerns of the student in the group chat even though the student was asking politely,0

ms barellano is a goey type of a teacher and not a kj one to deal with miss is always encouraging us to continually chase our dreams and gives us hope and strength to keep going when the situation seems hard for us to see shes super optimistic,1
miss nodado is one of a kind professor that i have ever known shes ultimately approachable and considerate wherein she doesnt pressure and stress out students under her subject a 100 over 100 indeed si miss,1
mr tejo handles his job professionally and i can say he is expensive looking when presenting upfront something in the class on the way he talks hes super genuine and open to all sorts of comments towards the subject discussed that i like about,1
mr ibis is unpredictable to scrutinize where in fact hes a nice professor that delivers topic accordingly from the ppt however the tiring part is the reflection paper long homework tasks every end meeting that tests my temper on chasing my dream lol,1
miss tabernero is a wise and thoughtful professor she balances everything right and has the light for the unheard strongly accepts thoughts opinions and comments she is open for equality and favors with justice definitely have principles,1
maam ayaw paspasa pag discuss kay di mi kasabot hangyo lng nako maam na kwai gamay ang pagka strikta samot na kung di mi kasabot dayon sa imo gi discuss,0
ms adolfo is a calm professor with a natural aura she mentioned that its her first time teaching and i was its alright miss type of feeling that it will be okay to take things slowly but surely and i found her doing her best to deliver her topic,1
a very nice teacher the way she delivers or discuss the topics,1
mr caballero is an active professor that deeply pushes students to interact in all plausible ways to the class hes funny sometimes and encourages everyone to participate at all cost,1
dili effective ang teaching method dili mo hatag og example pero bootan,1
sige ra og pangsaba sayo sa buntag makapuol sad oy imbis na mag motivate sa iyang students iya na hinuon idown na mo undang,-1

ms fabio is a very good teacher she explains well enough for me to understand she is also very kind understanding and very easy to work with i am grateful for her glad she is my instructor for 2 subjects thank you ms juliet and god bless you,1
she sometimes goes out of the room 10 mins before the time which we should use that time to finish properly what activity she had given,0
she is very effective as an instructor and i really like how she handled us,1
his standards are too high,0
pinaka inconsiderate na maestro sa tanan pasudla tawn mi mga late sir kay lagyo pakay mi gi byahe ikaw ra ang giadto sa skwelahan di pajud ka mo consider hahays,-1
thank you doc sayson,1
i dont know if this is his area of knowledge but when we have our exam we are the ones who provide the answers one time theres a question that we dont know the answer and when we asked him he also dont have any idea he didnt teach us,0
til next time mam gonna miss your chikas based on your experienced and your teaching labyu,-1
my suggestion about this professor is that he should do more discussion because we cant understand the lessons that he gave us he will just say we have an oral about the topic and we dont have any idea of that topic,0
mo sud raman kag ganahan,0
he expects us to everything on our own he cant even give a simple guidance when we are doing the activities hes giving,1
we did all the work no proper understandable explanation but is always complaining and blaming the students,-1
sir margallo never pressure us instead he teach us to learn easily in his ways the jokes he made are really funny that can make the atmosphere in the classroom relax and calm he is the only teacher that can make the oral recitation fun,1
miss caliwan can be funny and serious at the same time she teaches with passion and always tried her best to make the discussion understandable the only suggestion that i can give is that during the discussion miss will use visaya often,1
this teacher doesnt know how to engage healthy relationship with his students he tend to get angry every time theres someone committed a mistake this teacher seems to be bipolar the school should hire teachers who are approachable,-1
this teacher doesnt know how to consider the background of her students such as to what strand her students had she also dont know how to teach in a way that shell give exams directly without discussing properly,0
such an excellent teacher the school should hire more teachers like her,1
no comments,-1
dili moanswer ug questions politely instead uses sarcasm modiscuss nga alihan ang board or diba magduko duko ra or murag hangin ang kaatubang dili imaximize ang time para discussion or exam mawaste kay magphone sha nya magwait rapud mi mo instruct sha,-1
always neat and on time in both face to face and online classes very good in maximizing time for exams and discussions,1
kudos to sir mga grabe kanindut ug way sa pagdiscuss and mogive jd sha advice namo as enginering students tagaan pud mi niyag video recorded discussion para naa mi matunan gipasayon ni sir and lisud na subject,1
i hope hed be better at handling jokes about mental health issues as it is offensive and is not a joke in the first place thats all,1
lisod kay sabton iyang ipang discuss niya og mangutana sad ka di sad niya ma explain og tarong,-1
she didnt discuss the topics she given to us shes just giving us a filelesson then let ourselves to study it and the next meeting she give us a quiz without teaching us or discussing it,1
i hope this teacher will be more approachable when handling her students its like she cant accept questions or answers in a sarcastic way she should be open to all concerns properly and not just left students with an inbox,1
i dont learn that much from her subject perhaps the activities that are given as well are not quite suitable for the subject matter i rarely see her discuss our topic i hope she makes an effort to make a ppt as well it is really helpful to the students,1
as what ive mentioned from her other subject i didnt learn that much as well her teaching methods and strategies are not effective she often ask us to search lesson from specific stories or movies she doesnt give clear instructions as well,-1
ms nianne is one of the great teachers that ive met she uses effective teaching methods and strategies that is appropriate for that subject matter she always encourages us whenever when we felt not okay i hope shell be my teacher next semester again,1
sir suson is a fantastic instructor for our engineering management course he covers all of the important points in both the context of the course material and realworld work situations,1
she indeed deliver every subject matter to us with easy to comprehend and understand from terms to calculations,1
one thing i truly like sir ledesma is he give us practice problems that we can solve again and again so we can truly absorb what his discussions is and the subject matter i can easily understand the subject matter through his discussions one of the best,1
he rarely meets with students announces midterm exams the night before and just sends notes and links to videos what good are my tuition fees if he only does this i truly regret in enrolling this subject under him what waste of money,1
he discuss the subject like he only talking to himself i like the subject but im sorry i dont like the instructor he discuss a topic that is different from the actual one he just blame us for getting small scores but hes teaching is so bad,-1
i truly learn and understand the subject but when it comes to quizes he ask different matter that he dont discuss he taught us numerical solutions but not the matlab codes that he want in his every laboratory and activities,1
in her discussion i truly feel her professionality and every discussion i learn something new and discover new from her topic and it makes me happy though she is strict in comes with instructions but i understand that,1
i want to true to my self the her teaching is mediocre,1
,0
hes a good teacher,1
not an effective teacher and doesnt know how to handle the concerns of his students i honestly dont want to be in his class again,1
angry birds,-1
thanks sir,1
appreciated kaayu si miss smooth sad mo instruct,-1
ill never get stress of him,-1
not checking attendance poor discussion giving pressure to his students instead of giving some activities to the students to get more grade he rarely give any assignments and activities,1
overall he is a great instructor but i think he should stick or follow with the learning and teaching plan they have in this subject,1

he doesnt attend to our classes regularly also he havent taught us during face to face classes and only sends youtube videos during onlince class it is a waste of money we are paying correctly but not receiving quality education please address this,1
he is not an effective and efficient teacher he doesnt meet students regularly during online and face to face classes and when he does he seldoms discuss the topicsit is not justifiable for us students to receive this kind of treatment waste of money,-1

hes a passionate prof and always inspires us to pursue our dreams he never left us in the middle of discussion if we still did not understand the discussion,1
teaching skills is extremely low the way he teach hes just translating the discussions 50 slides into cebuano and we cant understand a single lesson and makes a surprise quiz with word to word identification,-1
teaching skills is extremely good,1
i am an honest person and i agree that he is a good teacher but sometimes he doesnt take the class seriously well maybe beacause some of my classmates are too much for him to handle and yeah i dont care about my other classmatesi just wnt to learn,1
he is a great teacher thats all,1
he is a great teacher thats all,1
she is a great teacher,1
so far so so good he makes the room lively and he knows what he is doing i just hope he wont be in a bad mood idk if i can handle,1
she is in the middle but i just hope that we could have a proper room most probably near uc,1
not the tchr related but the pe uniform it hasnt been given yet,0
she has been really considerate and kind i just want her to engage more in the lessons and gives feedback and add ups to the discussion,1
she really knows how to teach id admit i like the way she teach the most its just that sometimes she could put a lot of pressure to a certain someone and that sometimes she could be inconsiderate,1
i understand that he is a smart instructor i get his value and respect it its just that sometimes he can make a student feel bad about themselves he talks as if his mad and he is often irritable he teaches pass our capacity which isnt really good,-1
i love how considerate sir llyod to us,1
quizzes are so hard and let us talk 15 minutes only online not considering to those who has slow internet connection,-1
i noticed throughout this whole semester whenever she gives us students instructions such as submitting our activities after class she would never take it anymore and proceeds to say that she is busy and wont have time anymore which is unprofessional,-1
does not reply to students concern even though the answer of his exam is incorrect then the major problem in his teaching style is that he didnt discuss all of the topics when the major exam is near just like during the prelim period,-1
the best instructor that i encountered here in uc especially the way he discussed i understand well,1
i have a concerned about my midterm grade because there is a quiz and activity that he doesnt record it i dont know what is the reason but i have a scoreevidence that i take the quiz and i pass the activity before deadline,0
nothing to add,0

he is a good teacher and he is also very good in making us understand the topic he is discussing,1
the teacher lacks of time management and keeps pressuring students under her class if they did not achieve or make the goals and achievements shes expecting for,-1
di siya mo discuss mo hatag ra siyag e study namo din quiz dayon wa man lang niya gi discuss ang lesson,0
inconsiderate instructor always exceed his time hours he cant discuss the lesson properly because there is an error always,-1
whenever we make some clarifications out of the given instructions she tends not to address our concerns instead she would just tell us to read again and again the instructions given i hope she would have a bit of consideration for us,1
the way she discussed her lesson is just so plain she would just read the entire topic gives side comments or examples i admit i struggle a lot with her style of teaching she would then conduct an exam without completing the whole coverage discussion,-1
wala kaayo mi nasabtan sa iyang lesson kay dili sya mo discuss,0
i hope we cross paths again in higher accounting subjects she is an effective professor,1
he make us feel that we are not a good student even though we did our best to pass all of our project and activities on a said date and also he was always late on class,1

sir john mark is so unpredictable oftentimes our exams quizzes and activities depend on his mood,0
aggressive type of teacher most of my classmates dislike him,-1

shes good in teaching but shes not approachable teacher masyado syang mahigpit sa lahat ni ultimo sa class rules nya nasosobrahan na hindi sya masyadong nag didiscuss sa mga lesson at agad agad lang sya nag papaexam kaya yung iba na pre pressure,-1
when it comes on teaching she delivered it well but sometimes shes late and absent but theres some task that shell be givin shes not discussing her lesson well,1
hes dedicate and committed on his teaching skills he delivered it well and give some informative discussion and hes so considerable teacher that when theres some student that didnt answer his quiz he will automatically open it so that they can answer,1
hes so approachable teacher and aside from that hes so considerable that when theres some students who did not answer the quiz he will automatically open it so that they can answer,0

y sud x2 sa klase tapos mao pay kusog mang hagbong natural y record kay y attendance x2,1
a good teacher who doesnt let any students get left behind adjusts on the different learning attitudes of every students and handle hard situations effectively,1
a very effective teacher he knows how to make a hard lesson seem easy he also ensures that students are well disciplined,1
he is a fun teacher and also strict other times nonetheless he is a good teacher,1
always considerate to her students ms puntual also sets our learning environment more fun and engaging giving us the chance to learn as much as we can and have fun at the same time,1
mr kyamko was absent most of the time whenever he attend his classes with us which is very rare he wont do any discussions and just let us answer an activity he also gave the same grade to everyone in our class i find it very unfair,-1
she would give us more exposure in class as a way to learn better and master the lesson easier i love her method but she doesnt recognize other students who dont excel,1
a very considerate and funny teacher,1
he doesnt require recitations his exams were very distant from the lessons tackled i find his other joke inappropriate also bowever he is considerate on the activities and deadlines,1

to fast discussion,0
please have presence of mind in presenting your uploaded activities on lms because it will lead the students to confusion and handle your students concerns and clarifications ahead of time,0
please be more patient in handling your students and give considerations dont rush in giving activities and quizzes because not all students have the same minds that we can study the quiz right away and inform us the coverage so that we can prepare,1
give your students a feedback of their scores so as to assess where did they go wrong and be patient in handling your student because the subject is already hard so you should at least be approachable,-1
youre a good teacher and you can achieve greater things given that you have a potential but please prepare a proper lesson plan to your students,1
telling about your story in life is great but this subject is laboratory and a major subject so we must have more mastery in subject specially in taking ink fingerprints that we can use in the future,1
please dont relate your topics to politics and dont be a peddler of fake news knowing that youre a teacher of ethics then you must know the code of ethics and not be biased improve your way of teaching and not just reading your uploaded video on lms,-1
we admire your consideration towards your students maybe in the other multiverse we get to know more about literature but for now we have to focus more on our majors thank you for sharing your knowledge with us maam,1

i love how maam handles and teach us her students because it really gives a huge impact to ushoweverthe way she gives activities to students became too much to the point that it sometimes drains usi hope everything is well,1
i appreciate maam montezon so much and i love her as our teacher lshes so considerate and her teaching style was so good to the point that even if you dont listen you can still learn something because she always gives examples,1

he helps us to enhance our skills and has a good teaching style,1
really good at teaching but the grades he gave is not enough and i think i deserve some good grades because i know to myself that i am not bad at this subject,1
sir is strict but thats a good thing but sometimes its not in the right place,1

clearly has a wide experience in teaching and utilizing it along with great understanding of the subject and patience for her to teach us,1
keep it up miss i know its your first time teaching so its understandable youre a great teacher,1

often times he flies off on another discussion unrelated to our lessons though it can be fun to listen to,1
very chill and a very cool instructor,1
he teaches well his students adore him,1
hes one of the teachers that i like most and in terms of overall capabilities hes quite good exactly what i would expect from a college professor,1
hes a very memorable teacher especially since hes the first english teacher that i had at the start of college and im glad i knew him,1
ah yes my favorite teacher what can i say fun quirky and funny every class with him is never boring and i also love the fact that he cares for his students so much despite us being quite annoying at times thats a respectable teacher,1
he is okay when it comes to everything else i just think he could make his teaching more engaging and provides a visual representation in discussions to make his students learn why it became that and that,1
hes a kind and gentle teacher i like that about him but sometimes he doesnt know stuff in his lessons especially when we ask questions regarding his topics or activities and i think it could be improved,1
she is the kind of teacher who does her duties just as required and its honestly commendable she is kind sweet and gentle,1
she is also one of the teachers who does her work just as required but sometimes she generalizes a little bit too much which could leave a scar on the students impression overall shes fine,1
sir ferolino where do i even begin first of all hes great and definitely one of the teachers that i like others have an opinion about his ways but its not mine to tell overall i think hes amazing in that he knows his work truly praiseworthy,1

shes knowledgeable when it comes to computer laboratory classes first half of our classes went very well second half was a bit of a downhill as there was a shift when it comes to lectures and materials appreciated it still though,1
unfair didnt allowed me to pass my 3 activities even tho i had a valid reason and i tired showing him my medical record yet he reopens the final exam for those who wasnt able to take if as long as their reason was valid,-1
good teacher pacing is good handles the subject in a way that it is on a minor subjects level but still has an impact on the students knowledge,1
kind teacher,1
the best teacher uc had to offer even though the lessons and exams were hard i still learned a lot,1
he doesnt discuss he just takes quizzes every day always studies why doesnt he discuss to understand and not clarify when he has our class,0
sir danny never attends to our concerns regarding our grades when we ask about our grades he just leaves us on seen and never answer our queries in our group chat,0
he is good with the subject but there is a problem in delivering the topics to the students end sometimes his discussion is quite confusing that lead us not to learn properly the topics,-1
she is the kind of a teacher that really give her best so that students can learn properly she provides activities that can make students learn at the same time having fun but she is very strict she will not give any considerations,1
he gives many activities in bulk,0

best rem professor,1
shes a patient and understanding teacher she extends help whenever needed she also responds to queries very much appreciated thank you ms,1
not my first time with her since i had her as instructor from the previous semester where classes are purely online though as observed the approach to learning was just the same students are the ones to report learning was like a oneway process,1
very understanding,0
he doesnt help discuss the topic,-1
his instructions are confusing sometimes,-1
he discusses the topic in detail which helps me,1
he is kind,1
god bless sir thank you for being my teacher this sem,1

he discusses the topic like a robot,1
i love the motivation he gives i can understand the topic he discusses,1
she has great patience thank you,1
i hope she will discuss more in face to face setting because it is very effective,1
i love how she uses real life situations when teaching it is very effective for me as a student,1
she is nice as a person she is smart but honestly speaking i dont recommend her as a teacher in major subjects because as a student especially in my course which is bsa when something is confusing me i always asked her about it but she rarely replies,1
late announcement when going absent,0
a good and smart instructor but not the way of teaching,1
very energetic instructor and nice way of teaching english,1
a good and smart instructor just dont like the way of teaching,1
cool instructor mamaligya lag tag 30 na plates hahahaha,0
too many activities and projects but overall worth it,1
this instructor is all in one kudos to you maam we had a lot of fun during the semester,1
straightforward instructor terror but overall good and smart,1
always teach you where you had been wrong and jamming this instructor should be teaching a precalculus or calculus if he doesnt have conflict schedules,-1

he is a very considerate and understanding professor he inspires me so much to continue my journey and be an engineer someday,1
he is someone who i can learn a lot with,0
honestly i do not learn in her class at all all she does is read the lesson material and we cannot even hear her voice she does not even explain the lesson and we are too afraid to ask her she is inspiring though i just want to be intellegent likeher,1
he lets us wait for him for hours and gives us a specific time but doesnt follow his given time well be waiting for him for about 35 hrs for him to change his mind and tells us that he will only check it the next day or the day after,1
we have a hard time understanding the lesson since he doesnt teach it clearly and he takes a very long time to respond when we ask him to check something,-1
she is one of if not the best teachers i ever had thank you miss godbless,-1
great teaching skills thank you ms cheryl,1
great teaching skills thank you ms cheryl,1
the teacher satisfactorily conduct classes she manages to ensure that each student is able to get the discussion by addressing to their queries,1
excellent teacher who allows each student to learn based on their preference she is considerate in terms of adopting new teaching strategies she has also the ability to inspire many and be the best by sharing real life experiences relevant to her topic,1
a very excellent teacher in all fields she is able to guide us in our research journey as she is always ready to answer all our queries on time a rare teacher who is very attentive and detailed on students suggestions,1
she never taught us the right concepts she doesnt provide us proper lessons and provides quizzes and exams that are not on the coverage that she gave us shes unhealthy for the students,-1
he sometimes gives us too much activities and end up not checking it then we get low grades,-1
best teacher so far,1
god bless,1
the best teacher for me so far,1

ang guro ko na subject nato ay magaling mag bigay ng advice kung papaano gawin at kung ano ang dapat gawin sa pag gawa ng research,0
sa nstp naman marami akung natotonan sa mga leksyon kagaya noong kami ay tinuoroan kung paano mag rescue ng na aksedent at kung ano rin ang mga republic act,1
yung teacher ko sa philo ay magaling mag turo at maayus kasi dindahandahan nya ang pag turo sa aming mga studyante nya kung gaano ka halaga yung subject nya sa pang arawaraw namin at kung anoano ang mga kultura nating mga tao na dapat e respeto natin kahit hindi tayu kapariha ng kultura,0
so far the instructor is very good,1
so far the instructor is good,1
ang guro namin dito ay minsan lang sya pumapasok dahil sa may meeting sila pero nag iiwan din ng activity para sagutan namin para sa susunod nyang pag pasok may ma ituturo sya samin,-1
sa sc naman ay isa lang masasabi ko na pakagaling mag turo ng guro namin kasi isaisahin nya pag turo sa amin kung ano ang importansya nga supply chain management at nag ooral din sya every end of the discussion kung may natutunan ba yung mga studyante nya,-1
she is a very thoughtful teacher who puts a lot of thought into how she presents the material her lessons were engaging useful and she was very patient with everyone in class always encouraging her students to try,1
sa tmtariff management naman ay marami akung natotonan kung paano kunin ang mga incoterms at kung papano din mag solve ng dutiable value,1

maabot sya sa room nga 30 minutes nalay mabilin sa class time,0

okay raman si sir usahay kusog lang kaayo mosingit og mga reportings in which dili na mi ka voice out sa among explaination in which iyaha nang tingog moy molabi,1
he did not dsscus our topic and also usahay ra musulod sa klase,0
late usahay,0
very detailed kung mu disscuss and we can hear her voice evry discusion ky dakug tingog hehe,0
so far okay raman si maam,1
so far okay raman si maam but in terms of giving projects tests assignments pressure jud sya and she always aims for high standard that i as a student cant able to reach sometimes that pinnacle,1
teachers must consider students efforts due to teacher numb feelings so many student fail this subject due to reason that she mistakenly encode incorrect our grades and she promise to make it up next time to make our grades up but i bet she will not do it,-1

i like sir dumdum he is kind he go with the flow of his students like if there is jokes or funny he will laugh very much and then sir is really delivered his discussions that students can adapt or understand at the end of the discussions no confusion all of his discussions or slide presentations is not too long that is why students can study or review easily when he give assessment and activities it is come from the topic he discussed and fit with the capacity of the students,1

very pressured,-1
right minus wrong with 3040 items type of exam identifications is not helping,-1
i am wasting my money for this kind of teacher he lacks teaching approaches methods and techniques he is not well versed in teaching which result to incomprehensible methods when in discussions he was just mumbling we cant understand this teacher cant even teach what are we expecting of course we are expecting a low grades from this incompetent teacher the quality education that uc offering is defeated or not achieved,-1
sometimes he teaches so fast without considering if the students still catches the lessons,0
shes brilliant she inspires students to do better,1
encouraging the students to participate in doing the practical test or activity he motivates us in learning various things about our lessons during our class sessions,1

thats all thankyou,0
thankyou and godbless,0
thankyou soo much sir,0
thankyou,0
thanks miss,1
miss rheberg is a nice teacher and she presents herself on a very professional way but what i dont really like about her as a teacher is that she mostly doesnt update us if is not going to have a class since and when she discusses she just sits in front in that way we are not really learning a lot but shes still a good teacher,1
teacher mandel teaches us very well and she makes sure that we understand her lesson,1
miss ong is a very nice teacher yet she intend to teach us lesson that arent really necessary she is very punctual but there are also time that she ends our class very late she focuses more on discussing us with the whole lesson rather than focusing whether we really learned or not i know that she also gives her best but sometimes we cant understand the lesson anymore since we often times forget due to the fact that she discusses us too much lessons for weeks,1
miss puntual is a very good teacher she teaches us good in a way that we like to really participate in her subject but since i like english then probably because i more invested on her subject compared to the others but aside from her good side i can feel very unfair since i think she does favoritism from the students from previous class from the last semester and she is mostly sarcastic for a teacher,1
shes a great teacher keep it up miss,1
maam princess taught us very well in her lesson and she also taught us how to become good public speakers someday and to be confident,1
as a former president in nstp i think miss gutas is a very nice teacher the same as the previous teacher that we had on the last semester she gets along with us students and we are likely to get participative since she bonds with us very nicely but on the part where she teaches us i know that we also do have our ppts provided on the lms but the way she discusses isnt really that interesting for me since not a lot of us will listen to her except when we do small talks,-1
i really like sir dechos not only because hes a pe teacher since a lot of pe teacher gets along with their students but he discusses good and makes us participate more he makes the subject more enjoyable yet challenging at the same time i can assure that every time we have our pe class we always do have fun,1
i understand that miss gemma is a very busy person and that our building is quite far from the main campus that she is in but she rarely goes to our class and sometimes when she does she gets late and only has 30 minutes or less of her time left she sometimes makes the discussion very interesting but most of the time she just sit in front and discuss yet she makes a lot of question to us so that we can be participative,1
i like maam cadiz because she is a fun teacher yet sometimes i get bored with discussion she sometimes forgets about her discussion and rather continue the remaining time chitchatting with my fellow classmates,1
miss caliwan is a good teacher who really knows her lessons to discuss yet there was this time when 90 of class felt very unfair when she started treating us differently from other classes i know she enjoys teaching but also gives us too much pressure,-1
sir arnel taught us about the lessons that may help us every day especially in the future and he taught us how to manage our priorities in life,1
she teach us so good,1
fav eng teacher so muchh,1
good at teaching,1
best teacher for java program 3,1

he explained well about history and best teacher 3,1
cool teacher,1
i like this teacher 3,1
best pe teacher 3,1
chill and kind teacher,1
this teacher is not discussed any topics instead we make a reporting about the topics from prelim to final and he forced us to watch his theatre performance that is not part of the school,-1
dear teacher your teaching style is causing us stress we feel like youre underpaid and give us irrelevant topics you sit and listen while we discuss and understand the topics your quizzes are irrelevant and you dont bother to change them please reconsider your methods as we pay for this class and expect to learn something useful if this continues well have to address this with the school administration please take our feedback seriously sincerely your dissatisfied students,1
needs to improve his teaching gives students resource about programming but never discusses its contents he has his own topics to discuss but never the contents of the resource,1
relies too much on the reporters that he not even once discussed a topic uses reporters script to make the exam questions makes the exams irrelevant and unnecessarily hard by making us rely only on memorization makes fun of one of my classmates for being black is very hypocritical about his religion rants about that he has to attend our class even though hes sick has too big selfesteem throughout the whole semester all i can say is that he is a horrible professor,-1
his ways of teaching drains his students he disregards how to teach the students properly he only reads and always never teaches he lets students take quizzes everyday without ever announcing what topics will be in the quiz he lets his students report the topics probably because he does not know what subject he is teaching he relates his subject to religion which it doesnt help any students at all,-1
teaches really well 1010,1
very understanding and makes the class fun 1010,1
thankful for being my english 101 teacher,1
makes the class fun and teaches well 1010,1

of all foreign language teachers ive met guess shes not the right teacher for mandarin unapproachable unfriendly and highly thinks of her self thank you,0
hope she will improve,1
a teacher marks students as absent even if it is present gave 15mins allowance but wont allow student to go inside hoping this type of teacher wont exist at major subjects anymore,1
sir illut is really good and he makes sure we understand every lesson he discusses,1
dr gemma shares insight and life experiences that could help us sooner shes a good teacher,1
very excellent adviser,1
great teacher thank you so much for helping us learning new things about life miss salute to you,1
thank you so much for helping us on our demonstration doc calooy more learning to come and thank you for your efforts,1
thank you so much doc calooy,1
indeed she is an excellent teacher,1
in all honesty the teaching method that our teacher use is so disappointing and without a doubt in my mind i rarely benefit from it,-1
it is sad for me to say but i do not think he should be qualified to teach personally i think he rarely knows what he is talking about he even used our own report as a reviewer but all he did was read everything he also told us to attend a program that would help us get a better grade in his subject,1
i hope you will help me and take action thank you,1
sir jose is a great teacher and i am happy to be part of his class,1
dle considerate sa iyahang mga students and from prelim hangtod karun kami moy sige og report nya siya moy teacher nag bayad mis tuition para ma minaw sa iyahang discussion dle para mo discuss na iyaha mana nga work,1
teacher is good,1
the instructors teaching methodology primarily involves group reportings which some students find tedious furthermore the assessment style emphasizes memorization skills by relying on a rigid script for reporting and a subsequent test format that requires verbatim memorization the class content which appears to focus solely on reporting lacks opportunities for students to engage with humanities or arts topics as a result some students may find the course unstimulating,1
sir teaches well,1
maam is a good teacher,1
mr heubert ferolino is such a good teacher of mine he is very professional and ethical when it comes to his career he taught us how to become responsible for ourselves,1
like him i want to become a good computer programmer and be knowledgeable about computer science,1
i appreciated him and loved his way of teaching us,1
she is doing great so far and hoping for its consistency,1
she is a great teacher but sometimes shes not around during class so i will not rate her perfectly as she deserves,-1
she is a kind and considerate teacher so far i hope that uc will hire many teachers like her,1
mr ronnel echavez is such a dream teacher for every student aside from his professionalism he explains his topic detail by detail so far he is the only teacher who can do it for his students i hope that next school year he will be one of our instructors,1
i love physical education courses but what makes me love it more because of this instructor he is very energetic and professional in teaching us,1
so far in this course he has been the most lovable and considerate instructor i encountered i loved his presence in every class he loves to entertain and makes us laugh,1
she is a very good teacher to us,1
he is not my type of instructor so far at uc i will be honest about my opinion of this instructor he is always present during his class but we cannot feel his presence we feel pressured every before his exams or even quizzes this course seems so easy but the instructor makes it extremely hard hoping that his style of teaching will change since it does not make sense at all no offense but this minor subject is feeling major many activities are given than our majors have a great leave,1
she is a very good teacher and when it comes to some situation of the students she really understand or shall we say she is very understandable very considerate but when it comes to the task that she will gave she really helps us to develop more our capabilities and skills i had lots learning from her,1
nice teacher very chill,1
very nice teacher she is someone who is very competent and dedicated to her work we learn alot to you miss labyu,1
she really meet the goals in our class and was able to teach us something that is really beneficial when we will be in the field of teaching labyu miss,1
i noticed that sir would explain a topic like he knows it for real but if you know that topic well you can tell that his explanations were innacurate and as we tried to correct him he will immediately agrees with you during exam he would put nonsense questions that doesnt really relate to the answer at all he doesnt care all he does is copy and paste them from our report and pressure us to know all the nonsense questions,-1
very dedicated to her work and we can really see that she loves teaching even though this subject is difficult because its not that applicable or not that present here in the philippines she still do her best to help us learn from the subject and make it easier for us to really understand the subject and use it in the future labyu miss,1
she is really a good teacher she makes all her subjects easier and enjoyable,1
really a good teacher and always explain how the answer becomes such,1
very chill and helpful,1
he does not give notes for us to study and doesnt inform ahead of time if hell meet the class the other section was already busy with the upcoming activities but it seems like he has no plans for his students please assess the performance of this teacher because its time consuming to attend the class on time and he is not present,1
very nice teacher and good and chill and enjoyable and approachable,1
always late,0

he is first timer for the eteeap program but still able to perform well on his subject and lessons,1

explains subject lesson well understanding teacher can deliver the lesson in a simple way,1
mastery of the subject is evident no question about it he is understanding teacher can explain lesson well that student can easily understands,1
teacher centered,0
magaling mag discussed si sir maiintindihan mo talaga ang mga lesson na ibinabahagi niya araw araw,0
he teach us well,1
dean is such an inspiration,1
he does not have any consideration towards his students us and as well as he wont give us chances he gives an unreasonable low grade,-1
she is good with teaching and gives proper discussion during our class sessions though sometimes she tends to give tentative grade during the final computation after a major examination even though i did my best,1
he is an excellent teacher who never fails to be gentle with his students his joyous attitude is contagious he is the meaning of the phrase patience is a virtue of how considerate he is but he gives questionable remarks after an exam,1
i love this professor even though she is strict but she gives an excellent grade she is always considerate and i wholeheartedly hope that i can be her student next semester,1
literally the best pe teacher ever i love this pe teacher so much because he is a very free spirited teacher who always understands his students which make every hard work during the session worth the while gonna miss his jolly personality,1
he is a good teacher he makes a difficult subject like philosophy easy for us to digest he is a considerate he gives us the satisfaction of all our hard work through fair giving of remarks he never fail to make every class session interesting,1
undoubtedly one of the best professor in uc main he is a role model for every student he always uphold his principles in life he exercises integrity honesty and faith to god he is very considerate taught us about morality and being lawabiding his quizzes and examinations were not actually farfetched from our lessons which gives us the chance to redeem more gives us the fair grades we deserve he makes our classes far more interesting than we have expected,1
i hope next time he will be the one to discuss the topics from the beginning of the sem until the end,1
the instructor is good its just that there are some instances that i find unlikeable of her in terms of coming to class on time and regularly like last time she went on vacation didnt even give us heads up and after her vacation she instantly give us the semi final exam in the next day,1
the instructor discuss something else than what is in our course guide like the binary we really had a hard time to that because it is not in our course guide and we are not it students she gives quizzes and activities that she didnt discuss either,1
all goods but gamay mohatag ug grado and very strict,0
okay ramn ang grade chill ang teacher pero there some instances nga di sya kahibaw motudlo or mohandle sa subject i think,1
the best instructor although work up kaayo sa iya subject tungod sa mga performance well this is exactly what pe is,1
my only concern is that if she do a discussion she must refrain from stomping her feet because it always distract me from listening to her and when we are going to take an exam i am hoping she should also refrain from always talking because it really distract us and about the overtime of her class,-1
she will only come to class 20 minutes before the class ends everytime she sit and check attendance and done when she have time to discuss she just sit and read the book it is very clear that she didnt prepare her discussion and grades are very unjust,-1
sometimes shes a story teller and she give me a low grade because she accidentally did not saw my project and i am very disappointed because i am an academic scholar with maintaining grade,-1
the instructor is very very good when it comes to teaching the lesson the down side of her is that she dont know how to handle students she pressure us maybe because shes top in her board exam and she wants us to be like her she did us wrong in midterms very unjust to our section specially to us students who are innocent of her accusations of giving answer to other section so she make us suffer in midterms and other section maybe its her favorite gi pa open notes niya sa midterm exam,0
the teacher is competent and skilled in their subject matter the teacher also able to clearly teach her lesson very clearly with assessment afterwards when the teacher is done teaching they go for a quiz or an assignment if their is no time,1
the teacher is competent and skilled in their subject matter the teacher also go above and beyond to ensure their students learn and succeed on her class she also ensure the student had fun on her lesson,1
the teacher is competent and skilled in their subject matter the teacher also able to clearly articulate their ideas and facilitate discussions among students they also use assessment afterwards on her discussion,1
my concern is that when it comes to examination i am hoping that she would chnage her scoring system because it would be unfair to our part that our mistake is only 1 but it will equivalent to 4 or 5 points because her points in every question is equals to 4 or 5,-1
the teacher is competent and skilled in their subject matter the teacher who is strict is firm but also a fair teacher the teacher also is wellprepared and organized and plan engaging challenging lesson so that the students can learn she also gave us some good wisdom that came from her own experience,1
the teacher is competent and skilled in their subject matter the teacher is passionate on her job and also very engaging on her lesson,1
the teacher is competent and skilled in their subject matter the teacher focus on teaching the subject matter and helping each student to learn and succeed to the best of their ability the teacher is patient understanding and approachable and they make sure that all students feel comfortable asking questions and seeking clarification,1
i just wanted to say that i really like her teaching style because we are able to understand however when it comes to handling the students i am hoping the she would be more consideate about the feelings of the students and also lessen the pressure of the students,1
the teacher is competent and skilled in their subject matter the teacher focus on teaching the subject matter and helping each student to learn and succeed to the best of their ability the teacher is patient understanding and approachable and he make sure that all students feel comfortable asking questions and seeking clarification the teacher also sometimes be late on starting the class and also ending the class,1
the teacher is competent and skilled in their subject matter the teacher focus on teaching the subject matter and helping each student to learn and succeed to the best of their ability the teacher is patient understanding and approachable and she make sure that all students feel comfortable asking questions and seeking clarification,1
she is very approachable at the same time she makes us happy and alive always in the class,1
she is always jolly and make the class not boring and she always understands us always if sometimes she feel like we are tired,1
he is approachable but the discussion we cant really understand because sometimes its too broad for us,0
he is my instructor and based on my experience he lets his students discuss all of the lessons he never starts and ends on time as well resulting our second subject teacher to be mad at us always,-1
inconsiderate unapproachable and disrespectful nga teacher paspas kaayo motudlo di mi kasabot sa mga lessons,-1
doc gemma calooy one of teacher who is very active in every way,1

i think doc gemma calooy is doing a great job in handling us student observers,1
i think doc gemma calooy is doing a great job in facilitating student observers,1
i am very disappointed with his teaching style he does not even give his best effort to teach us about his subject he only gives us the topic for us student to report and not him even though it is his job to teach us student he does not even know the topics we were discussing about i hardly feel anything that makes me stay awake and listen to him i am very disappointed because i paid my tuition so should he do his work i am sorry if i am being mean or offensive but i am only being honest,1
he is very friendly and down to earth person his teaching is very effective and is fun,1
yayyyy very fun,1

the best teacher that i ever had in my college days,1
effective teacher,1
i really appreciate dr ares because she let us realize how teaching profession is a noble profession thankyou doc ares,1
i apologize for my choice of words but as a student that pays for the tuition fee coming from my family i think the teacher is not very good in teaching the subject he rarely discusses on his own and only relies to the students reports and doesnt even manually read it himself and he even makes the exams so difficult by only using identification method its ironic that he doesnt even clarify the reports i hope he change his ways of teaching because it can be so frustrating at times,-1
there is more time to process and grow just keep it up you can do it,0
doctor ares is a great instructor she is like a mother to us she never fails to remind us of everything that we need to comply with for this semester she is too approachable she entertained us with sarcasm and her wit indeed she is an epitome of a great teacher,1
in learned a lot from this class and at the same time having fun,1
effective teaching,1
he always used cellphone during class and i cant really understand the way he teach specially in terms of journal entry,0
she did not teach us well she always force us to study or self study for her to enable not to teach its unfair for us because majority of out class gave her a failing grades knowing she did not teach she also did not gave us reading materials she once gave us oral recitation and if one of us did not deliver the oral well she gave 30 or even 50 the coverage was so long and that subject is not the only subject that we have she always reflect our class to her law school experience,-1
i like miss rose because she is understanding yet she teach barely she always do reporting to students,1
considerate teacher,1
doc rex argate always monitor us all in class he attends the class on time he was able to facilitate our teaching demonstration well give prompt feedback and entertain concerns before he dismissed the class he is particular also with the deadline of our requirements and see to it that our output contains all the necessary and appropriate content,1
he is understanding towards the students and makes learning fun,1
ka nice nimo miss we hope naa always ka happy and ayaw kastress miss kay gwapaa kaykaa,1
thank you miss sa tanang lesson na imung gi tudlo namo,1
miss nilda is a good teacher,1
sir really understand the feelings of each student he make the atmosphere comfortable and more relaxed thats why if naay recitation confident gyud ang uban mo answer,1
i have observed that this minor subject we are studying appears to pose a greater level of difficulty than our major subject i would appreciate it if the professor were to consider adjusting their methods or ways of teaching us we also feel very pressured before his exams or quizzes,1

inefficient with their teachings throughout entire semester all we did was student individual reporting didnt give that much info of their own regarding each lesson for this course lack methods when doing exam since discussions were done by us so we concentrated solely on memorization rather than understanding the material whenever we study frequently irritable unable to manage their emotions and were the ones affected by it overall not to be rude theyre incompetent as a teacher,-1

shes a very nice teacher,1
please hear me out tbh i dont see her as a effective teacher shes not good on holding her emotions like seems like unprofessional behavior in fact she doesnt even discuss anything about our class never pa siya nag share ug thoughts or knowledge sa amoa thats why i cant tell that shes effective teacher towards us shes not capable enough to handle a class and thats the truth,1

what i like about sir tandingan is that he is chill but he never gives us a proper examples about the topic and always gives us quiz and seatwork,1
miss bernabe is a very good teacher,1
he is approachable and yet he must help us students ease up on our responsibilities as officers of the class it is all about helping to lessen the students grudges towards the teacher i answered with honesty,1

some instructions given by this instructor are unclear she is also hard to find on campus so students have a hard time during the signing of documents and consultation of topics nevertheless she is slightly considerate,0
she is a good teacher because she is always punctual and attends classes regularly however she oftentimes lets students explore the topics themselves and rarely gives discussions which led to confusion or not learning at all,1
i must express my utmost admiration for the professors exceptional teaching abilities his excellence in the classroom is truly remarkable with his profound knowledge engaging teaching style and unwavering dedication he creates an environment that fosters deep understanding and intellectual growth the professors ability to simplify complex concepts encourage critical thinking and inspire students is truly commendable,1

this instructor showed mastery of the subject especially tekla software which helped the students understand easily and correctly the topics at hand he is also considerate and understands the students struggles,1
dr rex would always be my inspiration since 1st year so lucky to have him as our teacher i would never forget about him,1
this instructor taught students the topics from the learning modules and integrates the lessons in reallife scenarios which helped students learn more than expected however his jokes sometimes went overboard without him noticing,1
sir joesenh uses learning materials and techniques that hook students to listen although sometimes he is unable to come to classes due to actually pretty valid reasons he still tries his best to catch up with the topics and makes sure to give us feedback on our outputs despite his tight schedule,1
this instructor makes sure that students learn the topics so he derives formulas and gives lots of examples per module he also admits his mistakes and lapses and always listens to the students opinionscorrections,1
engr marfa motivates us and help us to keep up with the lessons,1
sir carlsan makes sure that we understand the topic at hand on that specific day and assesses our learning through effective means although he often comes to class late and sometimes absent he still provides us with enough topics to learn and explains them as concisely and as clearly as possible,1
always do reporting but never teach us about the lesson she had given since the first day of class shes not teaching when we ask about the topic shes not answering it properly and always on a high temper thats why some students are afraid to ask her she gives us topic by group which we discuss the entire semester and she never teach or discuss even once,-1
he is a good teacher he always encourage us and very understanding,1
maam amores utilizes the necessary learning materials to help us better understand the topics to be tackled she explains the topic effectively and entertains questions as well she also makes sure that at least some of the students participate and encourages us to research more on some of the topics although her teaching style maybe traditional in some sense she executes it well,1
he is a good teacher and he discuss our lesson properly,1
thank you miss for teaching us na mag grow pa us a student,1
sir leo explains tackled topics by utilizing realtime teaching where hell create a programaction that is related to our subject and makes sure that everyone understands hes very keen on making sure that the students are listening to him and he gives activities and assessments that reflect the topics that we discussed prior,1

thank you kaayo sir kay very approachable ka and kabalo sad mo sabot sa student not to mention na maayo sad kaayo ka mo tudlo,-1
lack of humor in terms of discussion thats why some students are not listening properly,-1
sir odjinar although he means well struggles to thoroughly explain things during discussions without getting sidetracked he is quite prepared but just cant seem to effectively communicate regarding subject matters he also struggles to explain his own answers when we ask questions which is okay but can be hard as a student sometimes i dont have any agenda against him and i do hope that he improves his teaching skills,1
still in awe of this instructors mastery of structural analysis he helps students understand the topic more through derivations and principle simplifications he also helped students through his redemption lessons and quizzes,1
eventhough miss english ra dapat i sulti sa classroom haha but for that mas naka ingon ko sa ako kaugalingon na kaya diay nako bisag conscious ko sometime mo speak ug english you also teaches us very well so i must say deserve nimo i evaluate ug tarung,1

my teacher my hero,1
thank you engr greg you are one of those individuals that i look up to you inspire us aspiring engineers,1
sir odjinar often gets sidetracked with regards to the topics which often leads to him jumping from one to another he is moderately prepared but often overlooks his students capabilities in learning subject matters he also struggles to explain his own answers when we ask questions which is okay but can be hard as a student sometimes i dont have any agenda against him and i do hope that he improves his teaching skills,1
thank you po miss for teaching us very approchable sad kaayo ka,-1
always attend on class but the way he teach makes us some students be bored,-1
thank you miss your efforts on us are much appreciated,1

okay ra si engr bernabe motudlo jud siya sa topic,1
she discuss the lesson sometime and related it in our real life activities but the thing is we dont know why all of us failed in her class in midterm grade and she didnt tell us why all of us are failed some students are not attending properly due to their midterm grade that she failed and some students did not attending class anymore,-1
very good teacher very understanding shows professionalism and mastery of topics at all times,1
one of the best teachers at uc i like how he handles classes it is not dull and we learned how to discipline ourselves especially by coming to school early and prepared sadly he left us early however the substitute teacher mrs nodado was also good and understanding at every meeting we are always productive and she accepts the opinion of her students,1
engr bugna is a nice instructor good at explaining and approachable one,1
sir dd is great at teaching and discussing the necessary topics for the subject and he incorporates humor which enables students to feel more casual in the way that they learn he also strongly believes that his students are capable of whatever activity or assessment he dishes out which is good but can be pressuring at times his only downside is that he gives rather small grades regardless of whether or not your scores are high however he is a great mentor for his students,1
miss has indeed a mastery of the subject,-1
i had no any comments to her,-1
i have nothing else to say to dr rex argate because he knows what he is doing as a teacher and dean of the college of teacher education he is one of the people i admire as a teacher because he knows how to keep up with and interact with his students he doesnt pressure us when it comes to our school works he is amazing and intelligent,1
shes a kindhearted instructor,0
sir jeff often cant make it to class due to his hectic schedule but he does leave schoolwork and seatworks that make us read the chapters of the subject he also gives projects and activities that test our skills and assesses our learnings when he does come to class he discusses the lessons thoroughly and explains them effectively he is a good teacher with a busy schedule,1

i like that he always posts the requirements in the google classroom so that we know what to do or what to prioritize first,1
sir arts way of teaching is one of the best he gives us an example of the problem which allow us to easily understand the lesson and also gives us samples that we can learn so that we can improve it with our own ideas,1
kind and approachable,1
as a student ive noticed that she always arrives in class at least five minutes early and values a clean and peaceful learning environment however i believe that more class discussion and interaction opportunities would enhance her effectiveness as a teacher,1

he hasnt been attending in most of our classes during midterms and gave almost everyone in the class lowest grade very unprofessional i heard him gossiping about our class with another teacher he is always walking out of the class if he is not in the mood,-1
teacher is adequate i appreciate how she tries to relate with her students by sharing personal experiences and observations about reallife situations,1
none the best but sometimes uses points to manipulate us to join programs like joining the acquaintance party,1
we approach the teacher and she didnt consider when it is almost all of us didnt get to take the quiz because of how she make an announcement the lack of opportunities to review and seek clarification on our quiz performances hindered our ability to learn from our mistakes and improve it is disheartening when a teacher neglects their responsibility to ensure that assessments are clear and comprehensive as it directly impacts our academic progress and motivation,1
affirm sir,0
very inconsiderate teacher has favoritism very unprofessional uses inappropriate words to approach students it may be face to face or online has proofs very rude makes inappropriate rude comments in some specific situations,-1
affirm sir,0
nons,0
well done sir,1
salamat sir for correcting our mis conduct,0
my english teacher has been an exceptional educator and mentor their passion dedication and ability to connect with their students have made a significant impact on my academic and personal growth i am truly grateful for their guidance and support and i will carry the lessons and skills i have learned from them with me for years to come,1
10minute quizzes,0
sometimes rude very good in discouraging students uses inappropriate words in approaching students,-1
this teacher has a talent for making the subject matter engaging and relevant they use realworld examples and case studies to bring financial concepts to life which helps students to understand how they can be applied in practice by incorporating practical applications into their teaching this teacher helps students to develop the skills and confidence necessary to succeed in the field of finance,1
thank you for sharing us your knowledge ms we learned a lot from your subject and you also thank you,1
an exceptional nstp teacher and for all that you do for us your impact on our lives will be felt for years to come and we wish you all the best in your future endeavors,1
shes good but sometimes she yelled at us because we didnt arrange the chair properly when we were taking the quiz or exam,1
this pe teacher has been an outstanding asset to our school community their enthusiasm creativity and dedication to promoting physical fitness and healthy living have had a positive impact on our students both in and out of the classroom we are grateful for their hard work and commitment and we look forward to seeing the continued success of our students under their guidance,1
shes organized and likes us to stick to agreed schedulesdeadlines with the rest of the class also gives honest and helpful feedback each time we finish presenting our performance tasks,1
sometimes not attending on time however shes good at teaching,1
shes an inspiration to all of us her heart is so pure we could genuinely feel how much she loves each of her students dearly truly the best,1
it is clear that the behavior and teaching style of this psychology teacher are negatively impacting the learning experience of their students favoritism belittling behavior lack of organization unhelpful feedback and insensitivity towards diversity all create a hostile learning environment that is not conducive to student success it is important for the teacher to reflect on their behavior and make changes to ensure that they are providing a supportive and respectful learning environment,1
i dont like the rules when it comes to quizzes and exams because the rules is right minus wrong and the subject is not that easy if we have so many wrong our score will become lesser and also shes very strict but shes good at explaining the lesson,-1
good learning,1
niceee teacher,0
i like the way he teach as mr sherwin said as long as you deserved a high grade why not give it i can easily understand each topic because he relates it in a real life situation he gives us an oral every month before exam to make sure we understand the topic and what an experience we can never forget haha the mixed emotions the laughter and etci think this will be the most memorable moment in my sc 212 subject,1
gamay kay muhatag ug grado something is wrong,-1

pressuring students to take a quiz or exam in a short amount of time can be detrimental to their learning experience instead of taking the time to fully understand the material students may feel rushed and pressured to simply complete the test in the allotted time this can lead to incomplete or incorrect answers and ultimately a lack of understanding of the subject matter,-1

sir pacaldo is very good at teaching you can really understand what his explaining and also he never pressured us and his very good,1
her students wasnt able to understand her discussion and she give lower grades her students left hanging andthingking how she compute the grades,-1
the tariff management teachers approach of presenting more topics and less questions is causing frustration and confusion for the students this approach may not align with the expectations of the students or provide adequate support which can lead to disengagement and a negative attitude towards the course it is important for educators to consider the needs and expectations of their students when developing teaching strategies in order to promote effective learning,1

miss gemma is a great teacher in general but her flaws when teaching and grading is that she sometimes gives high grades to those she knows,1
oftentimes those who are very close to her became more closer and those student who did not even know her farther to her,0

a very super dedicated and motivated in his work and although i can see the stress in his eyes but he didnt show how stress he is even once,0
ms joy talks about god if given a chance which i found sweet on the other side not everyone believes in god man gyud and some ppl get sensitive when talking about religion as it involves personal experiences and not everyone has the same good experiences with this i hope next time their are boundaries na nalagay,1
ms joy is a good instructor she focus on the behavior of the students she might be strict sometimes but i know she did that for us only cause she wants us to grown into a better person,1

im so thankful for accepting us in his class and without him our class might as well be dissolve he is understanding and knows how to always appreciates the students performances though he lack interactions of his students but i cant really blame him he handles an approximately 100 students in our class schedule he deserves to have a proper venue in pe classes wherein he can hold classes comfortably without any distractions on the surroundings,1
i think sir should improve his teaching style and have to write the solutions on the board not just merely reading it,1
always the best in everything,1
he is very fast in teaching but its okay i can still follow,1
always on time teacher and a very calm and humble person,1
nocomment,0
sir trinidads signature move as a teacher is always bringing up surprise quiz and oral recitation after every discussion to check up our knowledge regarding to our lessons which is a good idea,1

sir pericless style of teaching is about putting discipline towards his students he always showed to us how does it feel to be able to listen snd respect when there is someone giving instructions his disciplined character reflects upon us that helped us to learn valuable lessons such as respect and obedience that we could inherit and used it as tool to achieve the better version of ourselves,1
we understand the situation of you sir,0
i like sir,1
i think she needs to do more discussing and talking to make us all understand the topics very well than to let us research for the upcoming topics through reporting because personally i cant rely on what my classmates just presented to the class most of the groups needs a clear understanding of the topic and be good at capturing the attention of the audiences other than that shes good at doing her job and always appreciates our performances,1
when students are discussing their assigned topic please do guide them and give them feedbacks so they can improve the next time around,1

he should change his teaching style i mean i like how he make various activities to show our understanding on the topic but whenever he discusses he needs to provide more examples on the board more writing not just merely sitting and explaining because personally i find the topics hard to comprehend when it is discussed verbally it needs to be on board so that i can clearly catch up on the topics he needs to be more active in messengerlms and respond quickly whenever we contact him,1

the evaluation scores are not because i intend to tarnish mr padigos ways of teaching hes just lacking the pieces of becoming a teacher he must adapt to understanding his students more well and not make them intimidated each time in every quizzesexams but i also understand he just wanted to reinforce discipline yet its way beyond that our grades are barely surviving even after exerting twice or thrice an effort on my end he needs a lesson too thank you,1

as for my opinion on sir allan i think he can improve his voice while speaking in front for there are students that are struggling to hear his voice and if possible to refrain from jokes that can make a student down,1
very strict but jolly teacher,1
excellent teacher and coordinator,1
sir dennis is really interesting to listen to in class because of his jammingjolly personality and very outgoing,1
sir allan romagos is a really great teacher and i wish for him to stay that way his teaching style makes a student to have hope in life and makes a student motivated and brings out each and everyone out to hisher comfort zone and every lesson he has discussed to us he relates it in real life and gives his own meaning to it for us to better understand the lesson,1

maam gemma is so very understanding and kind maam gemma is good at teaching,1
i just want to say a thing or two about the instructors way of teaching one of my concern is that when giving a quiz or seatwork or exam the instructor must give a written instruction because sometimes it will lead the students not to understand the instructions or perhaps the instructor might forget the instructions he gave and when the instructor checks the activity he might mark the activity given by the student wrong because the instructor himself might forget the instuction,-1

the professors consistent tardiness in arriving to the classroom is highly unprofessional and disrespectful towards students time punctuality is a fundamental expectation that sets a positive tone for the learning environment and their chronic lateness undermines the value of our education,0
overall i can tell that i learn something from this subject although i failed base from my midterm grade yet it motivates me to do so still i did and tried my best to be able to pass this subject i just hope instructors will also appreciate those students that really tried and do efforts just to pass not just those students whom they like or favourites,1
the only thing is that there have been many errors with online quizzes such as correct answers being marked wrong and during our midterm grade computations we found out that our grades were not adjusted in accordance with the errors i also believe that there are minor mistakes with the encoding of our grades because we had a decent score on quizzes and exams and yet our grades dont match our performance,-1

mrs bitoon is a great teacher but i noticed that she is a bit bias because she tends to entertain students who are fast learners more nicely than the others she also only give simple examples of problems during discussions but gives a more complex and difficult problems during quizzes,-1
mrs tampon doesnt really return our corrected paper and i believe that i dont deserve the grade she gave me during the midterms but i cant complain because i cant compute my grades since the papers werent returned to the students her way of teaching is like selflearning because the students must report a discussion about a certain topic that she have assigned so it is like we are learning in this subject by researching in the internet so we can share it with our classmates,1
she is good but tends to talk fast at times resulting to us students not to understand the lesson she is well groomed and good at the subject,1
he uses sexual jokes but bugs it off by saying that the ones who are laughing are just greenminded and he doesnt mean what he said in a sexual say but is obvious that it is his intention if he continues on with these jokes i can assure that the next students who will attend his class will feel uncomfortable specially girls,-1
our class style is reporting so he just listens and corrects the students he is good at the subject but sometimes do not discuss,1
she rarely attends our class and i can say that i havent learned enough about this subject which is very sad considering that it is a major subject i believe that we still have more to learn about this subject but werent able to so much time is wasted but ms escua is fun and approachable to her students the only downside is the frequent absences,-1
very kind and very approachable teacher,1
mrs generale is the perfect example of a perfect teacher i can always feel a tension always the moment i step inside her class but i can say that i am lucky that she is my adviser in this subject because i learned a lot from her she deserves a perfect score for being a perfect teacher,1
very good in discussing,1
she is good at teaching us about the subject but tends to have an attitude at times she is good and knows well about the subject,1
sir joselito is a very fun teacher he teaches the class in an interesting way,1
maam is good at teaching the subject she is also very kind and gentle towards us not pressuring us and is helping us,1
sir is vey good in discussing he is quite skilled in teaching and helps you to understand the subject well,1
he is good and funny while teaching but there are times that he gives too much activity and quizes to the students,1
the teacher is effective,1
she is good in teaching but sometimes just reads and skips some of the lessons in the book but overall she is good and great in teaching,1
from all of our instructors he is the very considerate instructor to us and he is very kind and sometimes she gave some jokes while hes teaching in order to catch our attention,1
maam is good in teaching but sometimes we cannot understand what she is saying for she has a soft voice,1
he is good in discussing and observing the class but sometimes his voice is not loud enough for us to hear,1
due to his age sir dont have a voice loud enough for all of us to hear but he is good in discussing the lessons and is good in giving explanations,1
makasabot jud kos iya discussion,0
makasabot jud sa discussion,0
she will be mad if we will chat her if it is not our class hours but on her side she will send us youtube links even at 12 in the midnight and even holidays or sunday it is so unfair to have an instructor like having that kind of mindset,-1
nothings,0
he knows the subject well,1
